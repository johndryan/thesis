# The Strategies of Individualism Inherent in the Social Web

> "The design of software builds the ideology into those actions that are the easiest to perform on the software designs that are becoming ubiquitous." (Lanier, 2010, p 47)

The contemporary Internet has become dominated by the presence of social networks. These networks, also referred to as social media, exist as online services or sites that facilitate social interrelations among individuals in networks of varying scales. Predominantly, they feature discrete nodes which represent each individual (e.g. a profile) accompanied by various services which join these nodes as social connections, most often around the 'sharing' of text, links and other media. They are predominately web-based tools, but increasingly exist as mobile applications as well. The social networking landscape is dominated by corporate giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. 

The presence of these social networks could be understood as an attempt to fill the gap between "a seductive but alienating possessive individualism on the one hand and the desire for a meaningful collective life on the other." (Harvey, 2007, p 69)  Fundamentally however, these social networking services are individual-centred; they place the individual user at the centre of their own bespoke reality. Why the individual and not the collective? Surely the collective is of primary importance in any understanding of the *social*. Should the social be limited to a world that revolves around the self?

The *faux social* of these networks serves to shape the individual into a more ideal candidate for serving and fuelling the market. At the same time, the network is profiting from their presence. This explicit redefining of the social into that which is consumed by the individual lies at the heart of the *strategies* of the social networks. 

Strategies, as theorised by de Certeau, manipulate power relationships through their creation of "a place that can be delimited as its own and serve as the base from which relations with an exteriority composed of targets… (customers… [etc.]) can be managed." (de Certeau, 1984, p 37) These new *social* spaces are literal abstractions that schematise relationships, implementing strategic network architectures in code that translate these organic structures to the strict, defined, and imposed schemas of the web, which can then be leveraged, controlled, and directed by those in power.

The strategies at play include commodification of the individual, User-Centred Design, and creating a myth of freedom whilst enforcing standardised presences.

## Commodification of the Individual

How is the *value* of the individual emphasised and interpreted through social networking sites? The individual point of view, although it would seem to lie at the centre of this new social space, is not a priority of the inherent ideology; it is a means to an end. The true value of the individual lies not in their contribution, but in their market value. Although the apparent purpose of these tools may be expressed as social connection, empowering the individual through the ability to communicate, these institutions are first answerable to their shareholders and investors. The line connecting each node in the social network is *the (financial) bottom line*.

> "Since the companies that create social media platforms make money from having as many users as possible visit them (they do so by serving ads, by selling data about usage to other companies, by selling add-on services, and so on), they have a direct interest in having users pour as much of their lives into these platforms as possible." (Manovich, 2009, p 325)

As Manovich describes, these networks are funded commercially, primarily through advertising and selling collated user information. The individual is commodified, literally, as their  data is analysed and packaged for advertisers. Earlier in Web history, bloggers began to use advertising to make money from their self-generated content; in the social media model, the network makes money from user-generated content.

The free-market self who inhabits the social network, constructing and expressing themselves there, is constantly offered, through advertising, the opportunity to purchase a better self, upgrade their identity, and accessorise their lifestyle with select, relevant consumer products:

> The consumer figures the pos­si­bil­i­ty of en­joy­ment prom­ised by neoliberalism. Con­sump­tion pro­vides the ter­rain with­in which my iden­ti­ty, my lifestyle, can be con­structed, pur­chased, and made over. Yet con­sump­tion is more than a ter­rain—the con­sum­er is com­manded to en­joy, com­pelled by the im­pos­si­ble de­mand to do more, be more, have more, change more. (Dean, 2009, 67)

I consume, therefore I am.

But there is a further commodification of the individual being promoted in these social spaces: these networks enable and encourage a form of possessive individualism which sees the individual literally adopting marketing strategies for themselves. The consumption and commodification of the individual that Macpherson describes is evident in the kind of 'self-expression' that social networks perpetuate. The social network self strives to be seen as concurrently unique *and* conforming; they self-market themselves in a supply-and-demand fashion. They see more *value* in themselves as they are increasingly consumed.  Within the social network, everything becomes a marketing tool for the self, exemplifying the demands of neoliberalism for "flexible, self-starting subjects willing to convert all of life into capital." (Horning, 2012) The social network strategically fosters an understanding of the individual rooted in consumption. It redefines—and redesigns—the social around an individualistic economy which understands the self as the ultimate commodity:

> "In using social media, we become fatally aware of how we can sell ourselves and thus intensify self-marketing practices. We put ourselves forward as a brand in order to register in these commercially oriented, quantification-driven systems." (Horning, 2012)

Moreover, this understanding of the individual is cleverly designed to perpetuate itself. In the attention economy of the social network, if you are not garnering enough attention, then you need to invest more of yourself to earn the attention you deserve. Literal financial investment is even possible, in the case of Facebook's sponsored posts which allow the user to pay to have their content more prominently featured.

I am consumed, therefore I am.

## A critique of User-Centred Design

The individuals of the web, no matter what the context, are predominantly referred to as *'users'*: implying they are putting the web to use. In these social networks, the term *users* persists, pointing towards this expectation for the functional and productive. *Users* are present to produce and consume. The further, and more fundamental, reason behind the use of the term *user*, and not *audience* as in old media, is the strategic dominance of individualism.

User-Centred Design, the design approach behind many of these services, places the needs and desires of end-users at the centre of the design process. Initially popularised by Donald Norman, this design approach has become central to much contemporary design thinking, particularly interaction design for technology and the web. User-Centred Design *centers* the design around the user, creating a bespoke world that positions them at its core.[<sup id="fn1">1</sup>](#1) Here we can see this ideological individualism designed into the very fabric of the systems, technologies and interfaces of social networking.

By centring me in my own customised reality, these user-centred services encourage me to select the friend or network that will give the response desired at any given moment. Again, we see the entrepreneurial neoliberal approach: strategic investments in the relational 'market' to get the best possible returns. Furthermore, it implies that the user is always right, and, as Woods suggests, "assumes that what individual consumers want will benefit the whole system" (2012).

In fact, one can curate the community around oneself to be sheltered entirely from anyone with a differing hobby, world-view, or perspective. Such curated communities can reinforce particular expressions of self, forming groups that embody the demographic divisions that define them. Varnelis describes such curated communities as "telecocoons":

> "Given the vast number of possible clusters one can associate with, it becomes easy to find a comfortable niche with people just like oneself, among other individuals whose views merely reinforce one’s own. If the Internet is hardly responsible for this condition, it still can exacerbate it, giving us the illusion that we are connecting with others. " (Varnelis, 2008, p157)

Social networking provides an experience of the collective, of the social, that gives the individual ultimate curatorial control. This technological narcissism might be better described as solipsistic rather than social.

> "Narcissism is a symptomatic trait of self-identity in the phase of modernity. Consumer capitalism perpetuates the flawed project of self-love which encourages individualism and discourages ‘giving to others’." (Giddens, 1991, p 173)

## The Freedom Myth of Standardised Presences

> "Web 2.0 designs actively demand that people define themselves downward." (Lanier 2010)

The results of User-Centred Design can mask the conforming nature of social networks. The user is given the illusion of being in control, being at the centre, choosing how they *use* the *service*; this all serves to mask the ways in which these tools are using us, the user.

There is a false freedom in these networks, that doesn't allow a free individuality, but uses the strategy of consumeristic individualism to enforce conformity. Lanier (2010) describes social networks, such as Facebook, as "standardized presences." Individuals have control over how they present themselves, but only to the extent that the structures of the system itself allows. The social network's design to create a fixed format for self-expression reduces people to abstractions. In a literal sense, people become objects; a computer term referring to a particular instance of data in a common format, but referenced by a unique identifier. In these networks, we are represented by such code objects. On this machine level, the ideologically-controlled individualism is inherent in the formats, data structures and system architectures of these networks.

Facebook's multiple—choice identities, demographic database fields and ubiquitous *'Status Update'* textboxes can be interpreted as equivalent to Foucault's *enclosures that mould* and—even more so—Deleuze's *controls that modulate* people into data ‘dividuals’.

> "The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become 'dividuals,' and masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks…' The disciplinary man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network." (Deleuze, 1992, p 5)

Gal­lo­way (2004), discussing Deleuze's *societies of control*, explicitly describes computer protocols as "mechanisms of contemporary control" in so far as they "encode appropriate behaviour in advance" (Dean, 2009, p 185). These computational "codes, techniques, and arrangements… distribute and manage" the individual within the social network.

Particularly with the ideological focus I previously outlined, we can understand the system from a Deleuzian perspective as transforming us into *dividuals* by breaking us down to our base component data elements, before recompiling us into 'useful' demographic groups for economic purposes.

> The "dividual" —a physically embodied human subject that is endlessly divisible and reducible to data representations via the modern technologies of control, like computer-based systems. (Williams, 2005)

The particular ideological individualism that is promoted and encouraged, enables this dissolution of the self to constituent elements, to be reformed not as individuals but as demographics, ones in which we are powerless. In this way, the ideological individualism of these networks has a normalising effect. The *standardised presences* of social networks transform individuality into a mode of conformity. The social becomes not a medium for individual expression, but an engine for assimilation; an ironic assimilation which is fuelled by emphasising the individual. This entire process has not been forced upon us; we have consented entirely throughout.

> For Deleuze, the data gathered on us through the new technologies did not necessarily manifest our irreducible uniqueness. Rather, the very way that the data can be gathered about us and then used for and against us marks us as dividuals… For Deleuze, such technologies indicate that we as discrete selves are not in-divisible entities; on the contrary, we can be divided and subdivided endlessly.  (Williams, 2005)

In this way, through being provided with tools designed to enable expressions of our individual uniqueness, we are conformed: stripped of individuality and agency. 

I am unique and in control, therefore I am… not.

1. <small id="1">Woods (2012) describes Joseph Weizenbaum's computer program, ELIZA, which conversed with patients to diagnose medical conditions. It did so via screen-based questions in everyday language that were so convincing participants assumed they were talking to a human being. "Weizenbaum's experiment is that educated people become very susceptible to suggestion, once they are placed at the centre of their emotional universe." Could perhaps this centring of the user in the interactions of the social network be interpreted as a strategy to make them more susceptible to suggestions, coercion, and control?
