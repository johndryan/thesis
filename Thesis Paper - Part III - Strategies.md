# EVIDENCE OF INDIVIDUALISM : INHERENT IN TECHNOLOGY / SOCIAL SYSTEMS

The contemporary Internet has become dominated by the presence of social networks. The networks, or Social Media, can be defined as "a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content." (Kaplan & Haenlein) They include such corporate giants as Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus. 

> "If in the 1990s the web was mostly a publishing medium, in the 2000s it has increasingly become a communication medium." (Manovich)

The pervasive understandings of Neoliberal Individualism previously outlined are central/embodied in a number of key ways in these new social spaces of the Internet. In both their function and their format.

## Function/Purpose of Social Networks

### Expressed intention / Raison d'être == social connection
## Commodification of the Individual

The individual point of view, although it would seem to lie at the centre of this new social space, is not a priority of the inherent ideology; it is a means to an end. The true value of the Individual lies not in their contribution, but in their market value. Although, the apparent vision/purpose of these tools may be expressed as social connection, empowering the individual through ability to communication/broadcast, they are first answerable to their shareholders and investors. The line connecting each node in the social network is *the (financial) bottom line*.

> "Since the companies that create social media platforms make money from having as many users as possible visit them (they do so by serving ads, by selling data about usage to other companies, by selling add-on services, and so on), they have a direct interest in having users pour as much of their lives into these platforms as possible." (Manovich, 325)

How is the *value* of the Individual emphasised and interpreted through social networking sites? How does this particular conception of the Individual serve the free-market?

Firstly, on a more obvious level these networks are funded by advertising. IN fact our information is sold to advertisers [BACK THIS UP] Most obviously through the direct advertising to the users/inhabitant. The Individual is commodified, literally as their information and data is analysed and packaged for advertisers. Earlier in Web history, bloggers began to use advertising to make money from their self-generated content; in the social media model, Facebook makes money from User-generated content.

### Self-marketing practices


But furthermore, a deeper / more fundamental commodifcation of the self is taking place / being fostered in these social spaces: Furthermore / at a deeper level, these networks enable and encourage / perpetuate a form of possessive individualism which sees the Individual literally adopting marketing strategies. The consumption and commodification of the individual that Macpherson describes is evident in the kind of 'self-expression' that social networks encourages and perpetuates. This Self strives to be seen as concurrently unique *and* conforming; they self-market themselves in a supply-and-demand fashion. They see more *value* in themselves when they are increasingly consumed.  Discussing the demands of neoliberalism for "flexible, self-starting subjects willing to convert all of life into capital"(Horning), = everything becomes a marketing tool for the self. As these networks encourage a value linked with consumption, self-marketing practices have become central to "social networking". Designed around an Individualistic, neoliberal economy which understands the Self as commodity, 

> "In using social media, we become fatally aware of how we can sell ourselves and thus intensify self-marketing practices. We put ourselves forward as a brand in order to register in these commercially oriented, quantification-driven systems." (Horning)

-!!RE-READ Hi Haters Article?-

Moreover, this understanding of the Individual is cleverly designed to perpetuate itself. In the Attention Economy [DEFINE], if you are not garnering enough attention, then you need to invest more of yourself to earn the attention you deserve. (Literally with Facebook's sponsored posts?) The medium of the Web encourages one to select the friend or network that will give the response desired at any given moment. (competitive marketing) Private life, relationships, etc. -> the market

Equally the free-market self, is constantly offered the opportunity to purchase their better self.

> The con­sum­er fig­ures the pos­si­bil­i­ty of en­joy­ment prom­ised by neoliberalism. Con­sump­tion pro­vides the ter­rain with­in which my iden­ti­ty, my lifestyle, can be con­structed, pur­chased, and made over. Yet con­sump­tion is more than a ter­rain—the con­sum­er is com­manded to en­joy, com­pelled by the im­pos­si­ble de­mand to do more, be more, have more, change more. (Dean)

"I consume, therefore I am."

#### Ownership REMOVE?

If the Individual's owernship of self is central, what about these grey spaces?

With this commodification of the Self, questions of ownership also come to the fore. Who owns the Self that exists in the digital space: the physical Self creating and maintaining it, those who own the servers and hardware it inhabits, or the Self's audience who breath life into it through their attention and interactions? Issues of copyright and ownership becoming increasingly mainstream, not just in respect of personal data and information, but perhaps more fundamentally in respect of the represented Self itself. To a certain extent, I can choose how and to whom I present myself on a service like Facebook; but I don't have the same control over how I'm presented by Facebook to advertisers. Is this my 'me' or Facebook's 'me'? Who truly owns the digital Self in these networks?

[Does this point to a collectivism / egalitarian / non-ownership space in the virtual world?]

-Lanier (46), talking about authorship, describes a scenario where all the world's books are available digitally, in a format that enables "mashups of fragments that obscure the context and authorship of each fragment." He questions what this might this mean for authorship? In a similar way, what does this mean for the person? Do we loose ourselves amidst the endless mashups of our Self-fragments? In the midst of this blurring, where does one person end and the next begin?-

## Format of Social Networks

Moreso, the very format/structure of these networks…

### A critique of User-centered Design

From a *user's* perspective, it is arguably a tool primarily for consumption and production. But human beings not only *do*, they also (as the label implies) *be*. Where are the spaces and services for be-ing online? Why is it that the services that have exploded online are commercially backed, and only serve these limited agendas: consumption or production. Even social media *tools*—the supposedly intimate and personal corners of the web—are primarily focussed on these limited modes of interaction, even when it comes to presentations of the self. 

One of the key design approaches behind many of these services, User-Centered Design, reinforces this idea: the Selves of the web, no matter what the context, are referred to as *'users'*: implying they are putting the web to use. In these social networks, designed—it would seem—as places to *be*; the term *users* persists, pointing towards this expectation for the functional and productive. *Users* are present to produce and consume.

There is a further, and more fundamental, reason behind the use of the term *user*, and not *audience* as in old media: the crucial centrality of individualism. User-Centered Design *centers* the design around the User, putting them at the centre of their own bespoke reality.[<sup>3</sup>](#3) Inherent to these systems is a particular understanding of the Individual. The User, that these social networks and tools are designed for, is ultimately a particular ideological understanding of the Self. Their format and function promote a very particular understanding of the Individual, one I would argue that heavily promotes the ideals of Western Individualism and Neoliberal Consumerism. In fact, I believe that this ideological Individualism is embedded deeply within these systems and technologies.

WHAT IS USER CENTERED DESIGN

> In broad terms, user-centered design (UCD) is a type of user interface design and a process in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of a product are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process.
Integrates elements of interaction design, user research, cognitive science and ergonomics?

The design approach was popularised by Donald Norman… and has become central to much contemporary design thinking, particularly interaction design, the web, etc.

design based on the needs of the use

Puts me at the center of my own reality:
The medium of the Web encourages one to select the friend or network that will give the response desired at any given moment. (competitive marketing) In fact, one can curate the community around oneself to be sheltered entirely from anyone with a differing hobby, world-view, or perspective. Such curated communities can reinforce particular expressions of self, forming groups that embody the demographic divisions that define them.

Again, we see the entrepreneurial neoliberal approach: strategic investments in the relational 'market' to get the best possible returns.
> In personal ethics, the general neoliberal vision is that every human being is an entrepreneur managing their [sic] own life, and should act as such. -Moral philosophers call this is a virtue ethic, where human beings compare their actions to the way an ideal type would act – in this case the ideal entrepreneur.- Individuals who choose their friends, hobbies, sports, and partners, to maximise their status with future employers, are ethically neoliberal. -This attitude – not unusual among ambitious students – is unknown in any pre-existing moral philosophy, and is absent from early liberalism.- (Treanor, http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/neoliberalism.html)

The Customer is God (Woods)

narcissism, Technological Solipsism?

I have ultimate power / ultimate control (link with neoliberalism)

Woods discusses "Weizenbaum's experiment is that educated people become very susceptible to suggestion, once they are placed at the center of their emotional universe." Does this centring of the user in the interaction/network could it be interpreted as a strategy to make them susceptible to suggestion, cohesion, etc.

Woods "user-centered logic implies that the user is right. It tacitly assumes that what individual consumers want will benefit the whole system."

> Narcissism is a symptomatic trait of self-identity in the phase of modernity. Consumer capitalism perpetuates the flawed project of self-love which encourages individualism and discourages ‘giving to others’ (Giddens 1991: 173)

-FOOTNOTE: Human-centered… environment becomes a backdrop. John Woods aligns humanism in design "Yet, our species has become increasingly disconnected from the complex ecosystem that nourishes and sustains it."-

## The Freedom Myth of Standardised Presences

This centralising of the user in their bespoke world, masks the conforming nature of these networks. The User is given the illusion of being in control, (owernship) being at the centre, choosing how you *use* the *service*; hiding the ways in which these tools we are being used. 

### Standardised Presences / Digital Structures: Object-Oriented Self == CONTROLS THAT MODULATE?

False individualism?? False freedom? 

Not a free individuality, but conformity…/control…

> "[Is the] meaning of personhood reduced by the illusions of bits?" (Lanier 2010)

Lanier (2010) describes social networks such as Facebook as "Standardized Presences." Individuals have control over how they present themselves, but only to the extent that the structures of the system itself allows. The social network's design to create a fixed format for self-expression reduces people to abstractions. In a literal sense, people become objects; a computer term referring to a particular instance of data in a common format, but referenced by a unique identifier. In these networks, we are represented by such code objects.

Are ideologically biased modes of Self inherent in the formats, data structures and system architectures of these networks? Facebook's multiple—choice identities, demographic database fields and ubiquitous *'Status Update'* textboxes can be interpreted as equivalent to Foucault's *enclosures that mould* and—even more so—Deleuze's *controls that modulate* people into data ‘dividuals’.

> The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," and masses, samples, data, markets, or "banks…" The disciplinary man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network. (Deleuze 6)

-Deleuze's comments highlight an important point; we can no longer in these contexts deal with the Self solely as an individual; we must also understand the dividual Self within the Collective. I will begin to examine this in the next part of this paper.-

> "Web 2.0 designs actively demand that people define themselves downward." (Lanier 2010)

The kind of Individualism I described previously itself has a collectivising influence. The *Standardized Presences* of social networks transform Individuality into a mode of conformity. The Social Web becomes not a medium for individual expression, but an engine for assimilation. [Leads to ironic assimilation through emphasising the individual]

Particularly with the ideological focus I previously outlined, we can understand the system from a Deleuzian perspective as transforming us into *dividuals* by breaking us down to to our base component data elements, before recompiling us into 'useful' demographic groups for economic purposes.

> The "dividual" —a physically embodied human subject that is endlessly divisible and reducible to data representations via the modern technologies of control, like computer-based systems. (Williams)

The particular ideological Individualism that is promoted and encouraged, enables this dissolution of the Self to constituent elements, to be reformed not as individuals but as demographic collectives, ones in which we are powerless. This entire process has not been forced upon us; we have consented entirely throughout.

> For Deleuze, the data gathered on us through the new technologies did not necessarily manifest our irreducible uniqueness. Rather, the very way that the data can be gathered about us and then used for and against us marks us as dividuals… For Deleuze, such technologies indicate that we as discrete selves are not in-divisible entities; on the contrary, we can be divided and subdivided endlessly.  (Williams)

In this way, through being provided with tools to express our individual uniqueness, we in fact loose our individual agency / power / 

> "The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of individuals so finely that you end up with a mush." (Lanier)

-There are two responses to this Deleuzian loosing oneself in the crowd, one which sees us *powerless* and the other which sees us *powerful*.-

### CONTROLS THAT MODULATE

Gal­lo­way + Protocol

Dean on Gal­lo­way:
> Al­ex­an­der R. Gal­lo­way views com­put­er pro­to­cols as ad­di­tion­al such mech­a­nisms of con­tem­po­rary con­trol; as con­di­tions for ac­cess and com­mu­ni­ca­tion, pro­to­cols en­code ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­ior in ad­vance, as it were. See Pro­to­col. Gal­lo­way’s work makes par­tic­u­lar­ly clear why it is the case that “con­trol” should not be thought of in sim­ple bi­na­ry terms such that some­thing is ei­ther un­der con­trol or not, but should ra­ther be un­der­stood as codes, tech­niques, and ar­range­ments that dis­trib­ute and man­age.

Demographics - dividuals: collective is always in light of the individual.
-Due to the structures of the web, but particularly because of inherent ideological agendas, we are primarily dealt with as collectives (consumed as *dividuals* into them), although rarely addressed as such. IS there another way to understand/know/experience this. Web users increasingly perceive themselves as part of a larger 'online community'.-

Strategies…, even though once the tactical, 
The blogs, chat rooms, etc. means of communicating, forming community etc, that were initially run and owned by the inidivudals using them (primarily hackers, technologists and the early adopters of the web—who were usually those making it) what  was now tactical is now strategic, much of this interaction now taking place within the Stadardized Presences of Corporately -owned social networks.

### FAUX SOCIAL

> "‘I shop therefore I am’ and possessive individualism together construct a world of pseudo-satisfactions that is superficially exciting but hollow at its core." (Harvey)

The presence of these Social Networks in the first place, could be seen as fulfilling the gap between "a seductive but alienating possessive individualism on the one hand and the desire for a meaningful collective life on the other." (Harvey) If so, this is an opportunistic xxx on behalf of the networks… seeking to take this opportunity to provide a faux social space which can serve to shape the individual into a more ideal candidate for serving and fuelling the market, and at the same time profit from their presence.

Might another technologically mediated expression/experience of the social or the collective, provide an alternative / counter the possessive individualism of neoliberalism?

I argue is doesn't fulfil the social place, and it reinforces a self that sees me at the center of my world. The social sphere is one in which we experience ourselves as part of something larger, discover the world doesn't revolve around us, etc.
