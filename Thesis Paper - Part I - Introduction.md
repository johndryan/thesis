# PART I — Introduction

AYN RAND QUOTE??

## I contribute, therefore I am.

As the person increasingly is represented in both the digital and non-digital… increasing pressure to participate, to have a web presence… Reflecting what desire/pressure to contribute to larger society?

I don't see this as two/fractured self (?) but align with Nathan Jurgeson reading of much criticism of social media/web as a form of digital dualism
