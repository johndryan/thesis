# 1 - INTRO


The strategies of the corporately-owned and -run 'social' web reinforce a neoliberal individualism through a user-centered experience/world designed in to the core of these tools. Their Standardized Presences…

Tactical approaches to exposing/moving being this Individualism  towards a more collective understanding of the Social Web, by:

- Dispersing the fragmented Individual in the network: embracing the Deleuzian subdivided dividual "indeterminate trajectories." Furthermore, in this obscuring of the Self amidst the fragments, there lies the potential to encourage and enable a kind of individuality beyond possessive Western Individualism.

- Multiplexing the Individual in collective experiences and entities which see the collective node take precedence over the individual. Literally, losing oneself in the crowd. experiences that might enable individuals to feel this "oceanic" connectedness with the collective



## Abstract

Like other tools before it, the Internet reflects the ideological conditions it has grown within. -How? Who agrees with this.- From a *user's* perspective, it is arguably a tool primarily for consumption and production. -How so?- But human beings not only *do*, they also (as the label implies) *be*. 

Where are the spaces and services for be-ing online? Why is it that the 'social' services that have exploded in popularity online are commercially backed, and only serve these limited agendas: consumption or production. -how is this true?- Furthermore, these social networks *center* the experience around the *User*, putting them at the centre of their own bespoke reality. Their format and function -expand- promote a very particular understanding of the Individual, one that I argue heavily promotes the ideals of Western Individualism and Neoliberal Consumerism. In fact, I believe that this ideological Individualism is embedded deeply within these systems and technologies.

Potential

Furthermore, in this obscuring of the Self amidst the fragments, there lies the potential to encourage and enable a kind of individuality beyond possessive Western Individualism.

In designing interactions with an Algorithmic Collective, I am interested in creating such experiences that might enable individuals to feel this "oceanic" connectedness with the collective.

### Inherent Ideologies == INTRO

> "The design of software builds the ideology into those actions that are the easiest to perform on the software designs that are becoming ubiquitous." (Lanier 47)

The Internet has been idealised in popular culture as a place that is open and free; -prove this?- a utopian wilderness free of the power struggles of -ownership, identification and labelling???.- But that is just not the case. The internet is reliant on resources which much be paid for—servers, power, connectivity—and, for the most part, the people willing to pay for this infrastructure are those who want to make money from it. (Address this?) Like other tools before it—the Gutenberg printing press, Ford's production line—the Internet reflects the ideological conditions it has grown within.

Similarly, the internet as a network … not all nodes are equal

> "The Internet is not a wide-open space with nodes and links to nodes dis­trib­ut­ed in ran­dom fash­ion such that any one site is equal­ly as like­ly to get hits as any oth­er site. This open, smooth, vir­tu­al world of end­less and equal op­por­tu­ni­ty is a fan­ta­sy (and not sim­ply be­cause some countries cen­sor and block)." (Dean)

BE SPECIFIC: social networks, most popular spaces… seemingly 'social'  

# Ideology + Media???

**consumption or production**

From a *user's* perspective, it is arguably a tool primarily for consumption and production. But human beings not only *do*, they also (as the label implies) *be*. Where are the spaces and services for be-ing online? Why is it that the services that have exploded online are commercially backed, and only serve these limited agendas: consumption or production. Even social media *tools*—the supposedly intimate and personal corners of the web—are primarily focussed on these limited modes of interaction, even when it comes to presentations of the self. 

One of the key design approaches behind many of these services, User-Centered Design, reinforces this idea: the Selves of the web, no matter what the context, are referred to as *'users'*: implying they are putting the web to use. In these social networks, designed—it would seem—as places to *be*; the term *users* persists, pointing towards this expectation for the functional and productive. *Users* are present to produce and consume.

There is a further, and more fundamental, reason behind the use of the term *user*, and not *audience* as in old media: the crucial centrality of individualism. User-Centered Design *centers* the design around the User, putting them at the centre of their own bespoke reality.[<sup>3</sup>](#3) Inherent to these systems is a particular understanding of the Individual. The User, that these social networks and tools are designed for, is ultimately a particular ideological understanding of the Self. Their format/purpose(s) and function promote a very particular understanding of the Individual, one I would argue that heavily promotes the ideals of Western Individualism and Neoliberal Consumerism. In fact, I believe that this ideological Individualism is embedded deeply within these systems and technologies.

Social web services are tailored towards the individual. Why the individual and not the collective? Surely the **collective** is of primary importance in any understanding of the *Social*. 



The Internet should be the ultimate places of (inter-)connectedness, 



towards a more collective understanding of the Social Web
