## The persistent, co-located, collec-dividual self

The contemporary connected self is persistent and co-located, existing at multiple points along a spectrum between the 'absolutes' of the individual and the collective.

**This self is persistent**; a term borrowed from the language of computer systems, where files, cookies, and similar network objects 'persist'—maintaining their inherent values—across various instances of the applications, platforms, and locations that interact with them. The persistent self remains across multiple projections and representations: physical, digital, social, psychological, institutional… These various facets may share much or little in common, but they do overlap and inform one another. They form a cohesive whole.

**This self is co-located**; in both of its two contradictory meanings: ‘a single entity present in several locations’ *and* ‘several entities present in a single location’. In the co-located self, there is both a desire for the disembodied augmented presence that technology has enabled, as well as the experience of embodied collective presence. A combination of both of these meanings is also applicable: the desire to be present with multiple others in multiple 'locations'. 

**This self exists concurrently at various dimensions on a range from individual to collective; a collec-dividual**. The self is understood by a range of internalized sets of meanings which span those more 'individual' and those more 'corporate'; "as a person (nice, mean, hard working, creative, lazy), as an occupant of a role (mother, father, writer, student, worker, athlete, spouse), and as a member of a group (woman, man, person of color, democrat, republican)" (Davis). I hope to move across this spectrum as I move through this paper; starting to examine the individuality (persistent, multi-faceted and co-located) self, before focussing on the collective and concluding with a proposal for a collective self.
