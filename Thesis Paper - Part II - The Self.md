## The persistent, collocated, collec-dividual self

The contemporary [technologically-mediated] [digital-physical] (web-)connected/Western self is persistent and collocated, existing at multiple points along a spectrum between the 'absolutes' of the individual and the collective/many.

**This self is persistent**; a term borrowed from the language of computer systems, where files, cookies, and similar network objects 'persist'—maintaining their inherent values—across various instances of the applications, platforms, and locations that interact with them. The persistent self remains across multiple projections and representations: physical, digital, social, psychological, institutional… These various facets may share much or little in common, but they do overlap and inform one another. They form a cohesive whole.

-ORDER BETWEEN THESE 2, WHICH GOES FIRST v^-

**This self is collocated**; -WHICH SPELLING: Co-location- in both of its two contradictory meanings: ‘a single entity present in several locations’ *and* ‘several entities present in a single location’. In the collocated self, there is both a desire for the disembodied augmented presence technology has enabled (social networks, geolocation, video conferencing, remote sensing -INCLUDE EXAMPLES?- ), as well as embodied collective presence (occupation and protest, relational art/aesthetics, urban interventionism, flash mobs -INCLUDE EXAMPLES?- ). A combination of both of these meanings is also applicable: the desire to be present in/with the collective/multiple others in multiple 'locations'/ways simultaneously. 

**This self exists concurrently at various dimensions on a range from individual to collective; a collec-dividual**. The self is understood / self-identified by a range of internalized sets of meanings which span those more 'individual' and those more 'corporate'; "as a person (nice, mean, hard working, creative, lazy), as an occupant of a role (mother, father, writer, student, worker, athlete, spouse), and as a member of a group (woman, man, person of color, democrat, republican)" (Davis). I hope to move across this spectrum as I move through this paper; starting to examine the individuality (persistent, multi-faceted and collocated) self, before focussing on the collective ( -self?- ) and concluding with a proposal for a collective self I am investigating and designing interactions with.

## Digital Dualism

By defining the above as the self that I'm examining, I'm situating myself in a particular debate about the digital-physical self. [DO I NEED TO STATE THIS?]

> "Nobody who is on social networks everyday (and this is true for some 700 million of the 1,200 million social network users) is still the same person. It’s an online/offline interaction, not an esoteric virtual world." (Castells)

Numerous theorists and commentators in this area have defined two, or more, separate selves; the digital, or “virtual,” self and the physical “real” self. I disagree with this understanding, preferring to think of the digital-physical self as a coherent whole, with multiple heterogeneous representations. My understanding would align with those such as Jurgenson (2011), who argues that the concept of “first” and “second” selves creates a “false binary”. My understanding of the connected self as persistent and collocated, sides with Jurgenson in an understanding of the digital and physical as increasingly meshed. It is an understanding of the self that sees “digital and material realities dialectically co-construct[ing] each other.” (Jurgeson, 2009) 

{FOOTNOTE? He has coined the term "digital dualism" to refer to this bias to see the digital and the physical as separate. IRL Fetishism??}

> “People are enmeshing their physical and digital selves to the point where the distinction is becoming increasingly irrelevant.” (Jurgeson, 2011)

My perspective "implodes atoms and bits rather than holding them conceptually separate" (Jurgeson). Across the axes that I have outlined above, I see a fascinating complex, cohesive, and multiplexed[ -FOOTNOTE? define- ] self; an incredibly rich ground for research and design in this understanding of the digital-physical self.

-It even seems that even those central to these ideas, such as Sherry Turkle author of "The Second Self," are beginning to acknowledging the increasing complexity in more recent writing:-

> -"In games where we expect to play an avatar, we end up bring ourselves in the most revealing ways; on social-networking sites such as Facebook, we think we will be presenting ourselves, but our profile ends up as somebody else—often the fantasy of who we want to be. Distinctions blur." [EDIT: REMOVE QUOTE]-

### Excitement of a complex, multi-faceted self Dangerous changes / Exciting Potential

Shifting understandings and expressions of the self and society are not a new phenomenon, by any means. Throughout history, new forms of media, new cultural expressions, new political structures, and more, have  created new modes and avenues for self-expression, and new ways to understand ourselves. Communication-technologies, such as the Internet, hand-in-hand with increasingly global awareness have afforded "the possibility of having multiple, multi-layered, fluid, and endlessly adjustable senses of identity" (Meyrowitz).

For me, this represents a HUGELY POSITIVE SHIFT in many ways

Turkle quoting (Lifton) = "The self flourishes when provided with things diverse, disconnected, and global." Turkle, 179

OR AM I SAYING ITS BAD? MAYBE DON'T MAKE A GOOD/BAD CALL!!

I don't see these technologically-driven changes as having a net positive or negative affect on ourselves or our relationships. It, of course, changes things—for better and worse—but our understandings and experiences of the self and the social
are continually in flux. The changing is not something new to our age, although the particular expressions/potentials might be. When it comes to the influence of technology on the self and society, there are numerous "salvage paradigm" voices. Personally, I do not argue/blieve that social media and other recent examples of technological media cause a decline in the 'quality' of human relationships. But I do think they that empower/perpetuate a certain type of relating and self-presentation (or individualism) that serves the agenda of those in power: ownership / creators]. Perpetuate/empower a particular ideology.

[?? -MORE ON MEYROWITZ - new understandings of self/glocal- ]

** Not primarily interested [at this point] about that impact of the tech-self on our relationships/self in a broad way, but I am particularly interested in the inherent ideological biases—extremely important to examine as we are increasingly existing/representing ourselves in these spaces. In the practices, formats and strategies of the emerging social web, what underlying ideologies are 'locked-in'?

But be aware of underlying motivations / inherent ideological biases?

#### Inherent Ideologies

The development of the Internet (as a tool) obviously reflects the ideological conditions its has grown within. -From a 'user' perspective,- it is arguably a tool primarily for consumption and production. But human beings not only do, they also (as the name implies) be. -Where are the spaces/services/agendas for be-ing online?- Why is it that the services that have exploded online are commercially backed, and only serve one of these two limiting agendas: consumption and productivity. And why is there no outcry about that?

-Internet is perceived in popular culture as a place that is open, free—a liberal (?) wilderness free of the power struggles of ownership, identification and labelling. But this is just not the case. The internet is reliant on resources which much be paid for—servers, power, connectivity—and for the most part the people willing to pay for these things are those who want to make money from it. (Our media/tools reflects our ideology)-

Even social media 'tools'—the supposedly intimate and personal corners of the web—are primarily focussed on these same modes of being: production and consumption, even when it comes to presentations of the self [ -EXAMPLES- ]. One of the key design methodologies/approaches behind many of these services, to me illustrates this idea: User-Centered Design / User Experience Design. The selves of the web, no matter what the context, are referred to as 'users': implying they are putting the web to use. Even (especially?) in these social tools, aimed it would seem at/as places to *be*; the term *users* is used, pointing to how people… expectation— functional : there to produce and consume. (User and not audience as in old media: individualism is key

> "The design of software builds the ideology into those actions that are the easiest to perform on the software designs that are beaching ubiquitous. It is true that by using these tools, encouraged by the economics of free content, crowd dynamics, and lord aggregators to serve up fragments instead of considered whole expressions or arguments. The efforts of authors are appreciated in a manner that erases the boundaries between them." (Lanier 2010, p47)


These web services are tailored towards the individual. Why the individual and not the collective? There is inherent in these systems a particular understanding of the individual; the Self/User that these social networks and tools are designed for, is ultimately… an ideological one. They promote a very particular understanding of the Individual, one I would argue that heavily promotes the ideals of Western Individualism and neoliberal, that these ideologies are in fact embodied/embedded in these systems and technologies themselves.

The individual point of view, although it would seem to lie at the centre of this new social space, is not a priority of the inherent ideology. [Why not?]


### [ -Expand on Western Individualism- ]

##### Western Individualism: embodied in our technology?

How is the *value* of the individual emphasised throughout social networking sites?

'Self-expression' heavily linked with consumption. 

More specifically, the kind of Western Individualism I am referring to might be best identified as Macpherson's "possessive individualism", 

> in which an individual is conceived as the sole proprietor of his or her skills and owes nothing to society for them.

best-known contribution to political philosophy is the theory of "possessive individualism", in which an individual is conceived as the sole proprietor of his or her skills and owes nothing to society for them. These skills (and those of others) are a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market, and in such a society is demonstrated a selfish and unending thirst for consumption which is considered the crucial core of human nature.

## Possessive Individualism

Macpherson's "Possessive individualism" is a theory of human nature that views human beings as free agents who own themselves and have the ability to exchange their services, products, property and labor in markets to be traded.

> In a world where we post the majority of our personal data online, and states and corporations wield invasive tools to collect and market the rest, there is something profoundly hopeful in Anonymous's effacement of the self… The domain of Anonymous enables participants to practice a kind of individuality beyond -what anthropologist David Graeber, building on the seminal work of C.B. MacPherson, identifies as- "possessive individualism," defined as "those deeply internalized habits of thinking and feeling" whereby we view "everything around [us] primarily as actual or potential commercial property," (Varnelis)

Enlightenment thinkers sought to distinguish the individual from the community in order to understand society and situate the role of the individual in the context of materialist capitalism that was then emerging as the dominant economic system. Individuals were free to understand external reality through their own sensory perceptions and understanding through communal a priori categories. Individuals are thus able to make their own futures and religion, God, becomes less important. Once individuals are free from the categories that restricted them, they are free to make their own choices about themselves as commodities.

## Effect: Commodification of the individual. Commodification of self. Attention Economy

"In using social media, we become fatally aware of how we can sell ourselves and thus intensify self-marketing practices. We put ourselves forward as a brand in order to register in these commercially oriented, quantification-driven systems." (Horning)

Political theorist Jodi Dean derives this from the demands of neoliberalism for flexible, self-starting subjects willing to convert all of life into capital:

> Neoliberal ideology does not produce its subjects by interpolating them into symbolically anchored identities (structured according to conventions of gender, race, work, and national citizenship). Instead, it enjoins subjects to develop our creative potential and cultivate our individuality. Communicative capitalism’s circuits of entertainment and consumption supply the ever new experiences and accessories we use to perform this self-fashioning — I must be fit! I must be stylish! I must realize my dreams. I must because I can— everyone wins. If I don’t, not only am I a loser but I am not a person at all. I am not part of everyone. (Dean, Democracy and Other Neoliberal Fantasies, 66)

How does the idea of a unique individual serve the free-market? If I am my own person, striving to be seen as both unique and conforming… 
FASHION: ideas around consumption and fashion—the need to be different but also conform

> (1) participation in social media seems economically necessary under a neoliberal organization of work within a so-called attention economy. Self-surveillance yields self-branding, a packaging of the self to accommodate precarious economic conditions (one must be flexible, one must put the total personality to work in productivity, and so on).

Anonymous are a group who have explicitly linked this understanding of self with ideological agendas:

> "Anonymous [has] deflated the notion that such a thing as "private information" exists, as opposed to information in the public sphere. This distinction is one of the foundations of the neoliberal state, the very means by which individuality in constituted—and tracked. Anonymous has made it clear that there's no difference between what we imagine to be our private and public selves—between singular individuals and fragment "dividual," in Gilles Deleuze's terms." (Coleman)

System designed to perpetuate itself. FOMO, Attention economy.

> Social media seems experientially necessary to secure sense of social belonging and ontological security. To have a stable sense of self that is “relevant,” an identity with “integrity” with credibility on the burgeoning reputation market administered by Facebook and other online identity repositories. (Horning)

## OWNERSHIP + COMMODIFICATION OF THE SELF ONLINE?

See whiteboard

Questions of ownership. 'Ownership' of Self in the Digital Space

Ideas of copyright, ownership becoming increasingly mainstream. Questions of ownership of personal details, information and represented 'self'.

Is this my 'me' or Facebook's 'me'? I can choose who/how I present myself—Facebook sells my 'anonymised' (?) data as information to advertisers.

## Digital formats/structures: the medium is the message/database defines the user

Is the "meaning of personhood reduced by the illusions of bits?" (Lanier 2010)

Facebook's multiple choice identities.

How these modes of self / ideological biases are inherent in the formats, data structures and system architectures is something I'm really interested in, and unsure whether I should expand on in this paper or not?

Do these formats reflect Foucault's X and Deleuze's moulds?

> Enclosures are molds, distinct castings, but controls are a modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point. (Deleuze)

 The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," and masses, samples, data, markets, or "banks…" The disciplinary man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network.

### Standardized Presences

Lanier (2010) describes social networks such as Facebook as "Standardized Presences". Individuals have control over how they present themselves, but only to the extent that the structures of the system itself allows. The social network's design to create a fixed format for self-expression could be seen to reduce people to abstractions. […]


## END OF SECTION

Exciting potential for design, and exploring the self/community. At same time with inherent danger/awareness of ideological bias, particularly in social media.

Desire and motivation to lose oneself in the crowd/perceiving the self in the collective

## Meyrowitz

As Meyrowitz describes a fracturing between social space and physical space. MORE ON MEYROWITZ? Our locality is no longer the center of conceived world—it has become a backdrop. The prevalence of mediated experiences (and communication) means that we can live in places without fully integrating into place-defined communities. Moreover, Meyrowitz suggests that we increasingly “leapfrog over potential ‘significant others’ in the locality to find more distant self-mirrors who are more to our liking.”One of the primary implications of Meyrowitz’s argument is that the media-networked locality “affords the possibility of having multiple, multi-layered, fluid, and endlessly adjustable senses of identity.”

For me this is an extremely exciting design space to be working. (One that comes with great responsibility?)



Deleuzian "dividual"?
