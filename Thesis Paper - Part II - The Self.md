# PART II — The Self

> “People are enmeshing their physical and digital selves to the point where the distinction is becoming increasingly irrelevant.” (Jurgeson, 2011)

> "Social media seems experientially necessary to secure sense of social belonging and ontological security. To have a stable sense of self that is “relevant,” an identity with “integrity” with credibility on the burgeoning reputation market administered by Facebook and other online identity repositories." (Horning)

### Digital Dualism

> "Nobody who is on social networks everyday (and this is true for some 700 million of the 1,200 million social network users) is still the same person. It’s an online/offline interaction, not an esoteric virtual world." (Castells)

By defining the self that I'm examining as persistent and co-located, I situate myself within a particular debate about the digital-physical self. Numerous theorists and commentators in this area have defined two, or more, separate selves; the digital, or *'virtual'*, self and the physical *'real'* self.[<sup>1</sup>](#1) I disagree with this view; I understand the digital-physical self as a coherent whole, with multiple heterogeneous representations. My conception of this self aligns with those such as Jurgenson (2011), who argues that the concept of “first” and “second” selves creates a “false binary”. He coined the term "digital dualism" to refer to this bias to see the digital and the physical as separate.

My definition of the connected self as persistent and co-located, sees the digital and physical as increasingly meshed. It is an understanding of the self that sees “digital and material realities dialectically co-construct each other” (Jurgeson, 2009). This perspective "implodes atoms and bits rather than holding them conceptually separate." Across the axes that I have outlined above, I see a fascinating complex, cohesive, and multiplexed[<sup>2</sup>](#2) self; an incredibly rich ground for research and design in this understanding of the digital-physical self.

### Not a new phenomenon, in ways

Shifting understandings and expressions of the self and society are not a new phenomenon, obviously. Throughout history, new forms of media, new cultural expressions, new political structures, and more, have created new modes and avenues for self-expression, and new ways to understand ourselves. But modern technological developments see this increase exponentially. Communication-technologies, such as the Internet, hand-in-hand with increasingly global awareness have afforded "the possibility of having multiple, multi-layered, fluid, and endlessly adjustable senses of identity" (Meyrowitz).

For me, this represents an exciting shift in many ways for the Self (particularly as a interaction designer working with these technologies). Perhaps my understanding aligns with Lifton's Protean Self which sees the Self as flourishing when provided with things diverse, disconnected, and global. (Turkle, 179)

When it comes to the influence of technology on the Self and society, there are numerous "salvage paradigm" voices, such as the digital dualists. Personally, I do not believe that social media and other recent examples of technological-mediation cause a decline in the 'quality' of human relationships. They, of course, change our understandings and experiences of the self and the social on a micro level—for better and worse—but, at a macro level, these concepts are continually in flux. Their changing is not something new to our age, although the particular expressions and potentials available now might be. 

That said, I do think they that reinforce a type of relating and self-presentation that serves a particular ideological agenda. I believe it is important to examine and question the inherent ideological biases in these spaces and tools, particularly as we increasingly exist and represent ourselves in them.

In the practices, formats and strategies of the emerging social web, what underlying ideologies are 'locked-in'?

*{EDIT NOTE: I have some writing about what motivates this expansion of the self into these new digital environments. Should I include it?}*

### Inherent Ideologies

> "The design of software builds the ideology into those actions that are the easiest to perform on the software designs that are becoming ubiquitous." (Lanier 47)

The Internet is often perceived in popular culture as a place that is open and free; a wilderness free of the power struggles of ownership, identification and labelling. But that is just not the case. The internet is reliant on resources which much be paid for—servers, power, connectivity—and for the most part the people willing to pay for these things are those who want to make money from it. Like other tools before it—the Gutenberg printing press, Ford's production line—the Internet reflects the ideological conditions it has grown within.

From a *user's* perspective, it is arguably a tool primarily for consumption and production. But human beings not only *do*, they also (as the label implies) *be*. Where are the spaces and services for be-ing online? Why is it that the services that have exploded online are commercially backed, and only serve these limited agendas: consumption or production. 

Even social media *tools*—the supposedly intimate and personal corners of the web—are primarily focussed on these limited modes of interaction, even when it comes to presentations of the self. One of the key design approaches behind many of these services, User-Centered Design, reinforces this idea: the Selves of the web, no matter what the context, are referred to as *'users'*: implying they are putting the web to use. In these social networks, designed—it would seem—as places to *be*; the term *users* persists, pointing towards this expectation for the functional and productive. *Users* are there to produce and consume.

There is a further, and more fundamental, reason behind the use of the term *user*, and not *audience* as in old media: the crucial centrality of individualism. User-Centered Design *centers* the design around the User, putting them at the centre of their own bespoke reality.[<sup>3</sup>](#3) Inherent to these systems is a particular understanding of the Individual. The User, that these social networks and tools are designed for, is ultimately a particular ideological understanding of the Self. They promote a very particular understanding of the Individual, one I would argue that heavily promotes the ideals of Western Individualism and Neoliberal Consumerism. In fact, I believe that this ideological Individualism is embedded deeply within these systems and technologies.

### Western Individualism: embodied in our technology?

More specifically, the kind of Western Individualism I am referring to might be best identified as Macpherson's "Possessive Individualism," defined as "those deeply internalized habits of thinking and feeling" whereby we view "everything around [us] primarily as actual or potential commercial property" (Graeber). Macpherson's Self understands itself and its skills (and those of others) are a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market. "In such a society is demonstrated a selfish and unending thirst for consumption which is considered the crucial core of human nature." (Macpherson)

The individual point of view, although it would seem to lie at the centre of this new social space, is not a priority of the inherent ideology. It is a means to an end. The true value of the Individual lies not in their contribution, but in their market value.

*{EDIT NOTE: Expand further on this definition of Individualism?}*

### Commodification of the Individual

> "In using social media, we become fatally aware of how we can sell ourselves and thus intensify self-marketing practices. We put ourselves forward as a brand in order to register in these commercially oriented, quantification-driven systems." (Horning)

How is the *value* of the Individual emphasised and interpreted through social networking sites? How does this particular conception of the Individual serve the free-market?

The consumption and commodification of the individual that Macpherson describes is evident in the kind of 'self-expression' that social networks encourages and perpetuates. This Self strives to be seen as concurrently unique and conforming; they self-market themselves in a supply-and-demand fashion. They see more *value* in themselves when they are increasingly consumed.  Discussing the demands of neoliberalism for "flexible, self-starting subjects willing to convert all of life into capital"(Horning), Political theorist Jodi Dean derives the following:

> Neoliberal ideology does not produce its subjects by interpolating them into symbolically anchored identities (structured according to conventions of gender, race, work, and national citizenship). Instead, it enjoins subjects to develop our creative potential and cultivate our individuality. Communicative capitalism’s circuits of entertainment and consumption supply the ever new experiences and accessories we use to perform this self-fashioning — I must be fit! I must be stylish! I must realize my dreams. I must because I can— everyone wins. If I don’t, not only am I a loser but I am not a person at all. I am not part of everyone. (Dean, 66)

This understanding of Self is cleverly designed to perpetuate itself. In the Attention Economy, if you are not garnering enough attention, then you need to invest more of yourself to earn the attention you deserve. The medium of the Web encourages one to select the friend or network that will give the response desired at any given moment. In fact, one can curate the community around oneself to be sheltered entirely from anyone with a differing hobby, world-view, or perspective. Such curated communities can reinforce particular expressions of self, forming groups that embody the demographic divisions that define them.

With this commodification of the Self, questions of ownership also come to the fore. Who owns the Self that exists in the digital space: the physical Self creating and maintaining it, those who own the servers and hardware it inhabits, or the Self's audience who breath life into it through their attention and interactions? Issues of copyright and ownership becoming increasingly mainstream, not just in respect of personal data and information, but perhaps more fundamentally in respect of the represented Self itself. To a certain extent, I can choose how and to whom I present myself on a service like Facebook; but I don't have the same control over how I'm presented by Facebook to advertisers. Is this my 'me' or Facebook's 'me'? Who truly owns the digital Self in these networks?

Anonymous are a group who have explicitly linked this represented, social media Self with ideological agendas:

> "Anonymous [has] deflated the notion that such a thing as "private information" exists, as opposed to information in the public sphere. This distinction is one of the foundations of the neoliberal state, the very means by which individuality in constituted—and tracked. Anonymous has made it clear that there's no difference between what we imagine to be our private and public selves—between singular individuals and fragment "dividual," in Gilles Deleuze's terms." (Coleman)

### Digital Structures: Object-Oriented Self

> "[Is the] meaning of personhood reduced by the illusions of bits?" (Lanier 2010)

Lanier (2010) describes social networks such as Facebook as "Standardized Presences". Individuals have control over how they present themselves, but only to the extent that the structures of the system itself allows. The social network's design to create a fixed format for self-expression reduces people to abstractions. In a literal sense, people become objects; a computer term referring to a particular instance of data in a common format, but referenced by a unique identifier. In these networks, we are represented by such code objects.

Are ideologically biased modes of Self inherent in the formats, data structures and system architectures of these networks? Facebook's multiple—choice identities, demographic database fields and ubiquitous *'Status Update'* textboxes can be interpreted as equivalent to Foucault's *enclosures that mould* and—even more so—Deleuze's *controls that modulate* people into data ‘dividuals’.

> The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," and masses, samples, data, markets, or "banks…" The disciplinary man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network. (Deleuze 6)

Deleuze's comments highlight an important point; we can no longer in these contexts deal with the Self solely as an individual; we must also understand the dividual Self within the Collective. I will begin to examine this in the next part of this paper.

1. <span id="1">Jurgenson</span> coined the term "digital dualism" to refer to this bias to see the digital and the physical as separate. See: [Digital Dualism versus Augmented Reality](http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/02/24/digital-dualism-versus-augmented-reality/)
2. <span id="2">Multiplexed Self</span> "In telecommunications and computer networks, multiplexing (also known as muxing) is a method by which multiple analog message signals or digital data streams are combined into one signal over a shared medium." ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing)) I see this as an apt metaphor for describing the persistent, co-located self. *{EDIT NOTE: Perhaps I will expand upon this in the main body of text? I've already added it to an updated paper title.}*
3. Social web services are tailored towards the individual. Why the individual and not the collective? Surely the collective is of primary importance in any understanding of *social*.
