# PART II — The Collective

> "I feel that I am part of a larger thing, the Net, the Web. The world. It becomes a thing to me, a thing I am part of. And the people, too, I stop seeing them as individuals, really. They are part of this larger thing." — Interview with college student (Turkle 168)

In examining the Self, we see it integrally tied with the Collective. When examining the Self as expressed in the digital contexts I have been addressing, an accompanying examination of the Collective is essential for a number of additional reasons:

- Web users increasingly perceive themselves as part of a larger 'online community'.
- Due to the structures of the web, but particularly because of inherent ideological agendas, we are primarily dealt with as collectives (consumed as dividuals into them), although rarely addressed as such.

Furthermore, as I will outline in the final section of the paper, I am researching and designing experiences that explore perceiving the self in the collective and losing oneself in the crowd. Collective representation seems to be an ideal way to hijack our persistent, collocated 'identities'.

## Perceptions of Being Part of Something Larger

In the introduction, I stated that the contemporary self I am examining exists concurrently at various dimensions on a range from individual to collective. Since Hegel, the self has been conceived as what it understands itself not to be, i.e. The Other. This idea builds on a much earlier conception of the Self as part of a Collective. We understand identity and the Self across a range from individualist to collective.

Individualism, as described in previous section, obviously influences our perception and understanding of this. Even though the web is, as I've argued, a place where a particular ideological understanding of the Individual is perpetuated, it is also one sphere where people have a sense of being part of something larger than themselves. That is one of the most exciting aspects about the potential of the Internet for me personally.

On the Internet, people perceive themselves as being part of online communities in various forms (be they ones that are uniquely framed with them at the centre). The Internet is in many ways being perceived as the ultimate 'public sphere'.[<sup>1</sup>](#1)

Meyrowitz argues that electronic media lead to dissociation between physical place and social place (1985). Building on this, he suggests that through media-extended experiences, increasingly “people from other localities… serve as self-mirrors” (2005); the communities from which we reflect our senses of self are no longer limited to the local, and in fact increasingly exist elsewhere and are experienced via electronic media. He suggests that we “leapfrog over potential ‘significant others’ in the locality to find more distant self-mirrors who are more to our liking.”

## Mass Individualism

> "Web 2.0 designs actively demand that people define themselves downward." (Lanier 2010)

The kind of Individualism I described previously itself has a collectivising influence. The *Standardized Presences* of social networks transform Individuality into a mode of conformity. The Social Web becomes not a medium for individual expression, but an engine for assimilation.

Particularly with the ideological focus I previously, we can understand the system in a Deleuzian way transforming us into the *dividual* by breaking us down to to our base component data elements, before recompiling us into 'useful' demographic groups for economic purposes.

> The "dividual" —a physically embodied human subject that is endlessly divisible and reducible to data representations via the modern technologies of control, like computer-based systems. (Williams)

A particular ideological Individualism is promoted and encouraged, so that we can be easily broken down to our constituent elements, to be reformed not as individuals but as demographic collectives, ones in which we are powerless. This entire process has not been forced upon us; we have consented entirely throughout.

> For Deleuze, the data gathered on us through the new technologies did not necessarily manifest our irreducible uniqueness. Rather, the very way that the data can be gathered about us and then used for and against us marks us as dividuals… For Deleuze, such technologies indicate that we as discrete selves are not in-divisible entities; on the contrary, we can be divided and subdivided endlessly.  (Williams)

### Loosing oneself in the crowd

> "The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of individuals so finely that you end up with a mush." (Lanier)

There are two responses to the this Deleuzian loosing oneself in the crowd, one which sees us powerless and the other which sees us powerful.

The first response sees us mourning the loss of the Self. Lanier (46) talking about authorship describes a scenario where all the worlds books are available digitally, in a format that enables "mashups of fragments that obscure the context and authorship of each fragment." He questions what this might this mean for authorship? In a similar way, what does this mean for the person? Do we loose ourselves amidst the endless mashups of our Self-fragments? In the midst of this blurring, where does one person end and the next begin?

But I also see a positive potential in this. What about the joy of perceiving oneself in the collective? Perhaps the experience of it is desirable. Maybe this multi-Self-fragmentation offers some new collective intimacy? Perhaps there is a new Collaborative Self to be cultivated: one which asks the collective to form an opinion for us, thinking out-loud/online and reflecting in the cloud.

Furthermore, in this obscuring of the Self amidst the fragments, there lies to potential to encourage and enable a kind of individuality beyond possessive Western Individualism. 

> "Anonymous offers a provocative antithesis to the logic of constant self-publication, the desire to attain recognition or fame. The ethos of Anonymous in in opposition to celebrity, with the group configured as *e pluribus unum*: one from many. It is difficult, if not impossible, to discern what or whom lies behind the mask."

## The Collective on The Net: Some Existing Models

*{EDIT NOTE: I've got some rough work outing some existing models for collective authoring/representation online. Should I include, and expand upon, this section}*

What is present or lacking in these exisintg models? How are these examples relevant? I'm describing existing models to offer a new one?

	* Collaborative, Asynchronous Editing = wiki, source control
	* Collaborative, Synchronous Editing = team-produced content 
	* Hierarchical/editorial = online newspapers
	* Stream of Individuals = blogs, social networks
	* Collated Conversation = usenet, forums, email lists
	* Man as machine = Mechanical Turk 
	* Democratic/voting = Digg, Reddit
	* Collective world-building/role-playing = online gaming
	* Demographic/algorithmic
	* Causal = comments / trolling

## Relevant Work from Artists and Designers

*{EDIT NOTE: I will brief summarise of a number of works which I feel are relevant to this section of the paper}*

- Listening Post is an art installation by Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin that culls text fragments in real time from thousands of unrestricted Internet chat rooms, bulletin boards and other public forums. The texts are read (or sung) by a voice synthesizer, and simultaneously displayed across a suspended grid of more than two hundred small electronic screens.
- BIT.FALL (Julius Popp) pumps liquid into a 45-meter long tube on a wall. A software program sets out a pattern which only at certain points forms readable forms or letters which then disintegrate into chaos again.
*{EDIT NOTE: Add other two from blog}*
