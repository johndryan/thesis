# PART II — The Collective

> "I feel that I am part of a larger thing, the Net, the Web. The world. It becomes a thing to me, a thing I am part of. And the people, too, I stop seeing them as individuals, really. They are part of this larger thing." — Interview with college student (Turkle, 168)

> "The digital hive is growing at the expense of individuality." (Lanier 2010)

In examining the Self… we see integrally tied with that the collective

When discussing the Self, the logical counterpoint of the Other must be addressed. When examining the Self as expressed in the digital contexts I have been addressing, an accompanying examination of the Collective is essential for a number of additional reasons:

- we perceive that we are part of a larger 'online community'
- because of inherent ideological agendas, we are primarily dealt with (?) as collective(s), although rarely addressed as such

- We perceive ourselves as part of a collective. 
- Through the social systems of the web we are also consumed [as dividuals] into collectives, -through this economic agenda.-

Further more, As will outline in Part III, I am researching/designing experiences. Desire and motivation to lose oneself in the crowd/perceiving the self in the collective. Collective representation seems to be an ideal way to… Work that investigates Hijacking our persistent, collocated 'identities', particularly through emphasizing…

## From individuals to a larger things…
## Perceptions of 'Online Community'

In the Introduction, I stated that the contemporary self I am examining exists concurrently at various dimensions on a range from individual to collective. Since Hegel, the self has been conceived as what it understands itself not to be, i.e. The Other. The idea builds on a much earlier conception of the Self as part of a Collective. We understand our Selves identity across a range from individualist to collective.

Individualism, as described in previous section, obviously influences our perception and understanding of this. Even though the web is, as I've argued, a place where a particular ideological understanding of the Individual is perpetuated, it is also one sphere where people have a sense of being part of something larger than themselves. That is one of the most exciting aspects about the potential of the Internet for me personally.

On the Internet, people perceive themselves as being part of an online community, in various forms (be they ones that are uniquely framed with them at the centre). The Internet is in many ways being perceived as the ultimate 'public sphere'.

Meyrowitz argues that electronic media lead to dissociation between physical place and social place (1985). Building on this, he suggests that through media-extended experiences, increasingly “people from other localities… serve as self-mirrors” (2005); the communities from which we reflect our senses of self are no longer limited to the local, and in fact increasingly exist elsewhere and are experienced via electronic media. He suggests that we “leapfrog over potential ‘significant others’ in the locality to find more distant self-mirrors who are more to our liking.”

## The User as 'Dividual'

- Particularly with this ideological focus, the system itself in a Deleuzing way breaks us down to the 'dividual', to our bas component data elements, before recompiling us into 'useful' demographic groups (for marketing purposes)

## Mass Individualism

Standardized PResences Individuality as Conformity

## The Web: An Assimilation Engine?

"Web 2.0 designs actively demand that people define themselves downward." (Lanier 2010) "The digital hive is goring at the expense of individuality." (Lanier 2010)

Curated Communities reinforce particular expressions of self?  Demographic embodiment…

### Broken down to be…

Interesting to think about this process. A particular individual is promoted and encouraged, so that we can be broken down to our constituent elements, to be reformed not as individuals but as demographic collectives, ones in which we are powerless, -not by choice,- but have consented entirely through. Deleuze described

The "dividual" —a physically embodied human subject that is endlessly divisible and reducible to data representations via the modern technologies of control, like computer-based systems. (http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/1_1/williams.html)

> For Deleuze, the data gathered on us through the new technologies did not necessarily manifest our irreducible uniqueness. Rather, the very way that the data can be gathered about us and then used for and against us marks us as dividuals… For Deleuze, such technologies indicate that we as discrete selves are not in-divisible entities; on the contrary, we can be divided and subdivided endlessly.  (Williams)

Scale — eames powers of 10—fragmented, multiplicit self… and at the same time a fragment of multiple (and singular?) collective(s).

Loosing oneself in the crowd/perceiving the self in the collective

OPPORTUNITY: But as Deleuze presciently described in his "Postscript on Societies of Control," today the self is not so much constituted by any notion of identity but rather is reduced to "dividuals."[15] Instead of whole individuals, we are constituted in multiple micro-publics, inhabitants of simultaneously overlapping telecocoons, sharing telepresence with intimates in whom we are in near-constant touch, members of the 64 clustered demographics units described by the Claritas corporation's PRIZM system.

> For Deleuze, the data gathered on us through the new technologies did not necessarily manifest our irreducible uniqueness. Rather, the very way that the data can be gathered about us and then used for and against us marks us as dividuals. Deleuze wrote (1992): "The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. [....] Individuals have become 'dividuals' and masses [have become] samples, data, markets, or 'banks.'" For Deleuze, such technologies indicate that we as discrete selves are not in-divisible entities; on the contrary, we can be divided and subdivided endlessly. What starts as particular information about specific people—our selves—can be separated from us and recombined in new ways outside of our control. Such "recombinations" are based on the criteria deemed salient by those with access to the information, be they government officials or corporate marketeers. We live now, Deleuze held, within societies of control. How can we be deemed individual (in its irreducible and autonomous sense of agency) when we are divided into those with and without access. The very notion of individuality itself implies that actors are not only entitled to, but also capable of, effecting their will on the world. (Williams)

Two responses to 

### Loosing oneself in the crowd
-> Powerless: Deleuze
-> Powerful = Anonymous


> POWERLESS: "The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of individuals so finely that you end up with a mush." (Lanier)


> POWERFUL: Anonymous offers a provocative antithesis to the logic of constant self-publication, the desire to attain recognition or fame. The ethos of Anonymous in in opposition to celebrity, with the group configured as *e pluribus unum*: one from many. It is difficult, if not impossible, to discern what or whom lies behind the mask.

# Critique of loosing oneself in the crowd

# Blurring: Where does one person end and the next begin?

Lanier (2010 p46) talking about authorship describes a scenario where all the worlds books are available digitally, in a format that enables "mashups of fragments that obscure the context and authorship of each fragment." What might this mean for authorship?

In a similar way, what does this mean for the person?

## Ambient intimacy / constant connection

The experience of it: desirable. What about the joy of perceiving oneself in the collective? Intimacy without privacy? COLLECTIVE INTIMACY?

## DO I INCLUDE THIS?

What is present or lacking in these models?

## The Collective on The Net: Some existing models for collective authoring/representation online:

How are these examples relevant? I'm describing existing models to offer a new one?

	* Collaborative, Asynchronous Editing = wiki, source control
	* Collaborative, Synchronous Editing = team-produced content 
	* Hierarchical/editorial = online newspapers
	* Stream of Individuals = blogs, social networks
	* Collated Conversation = usenet, forums, email lists
	* Man as machine = Mechanical Turk 
	* Democratic/voting = Digg, Reddit
	* Collective world-building/role-playing = online gaming
	* Demographic/algorithmic
	* Causal = comments / trolling

Collectivism - Horizontal
	- Hive mind
- Collective consciousness

Lanier argues strongly against the idea of a noosphere, or a collective brain formed by a sum of all the people on the internet
