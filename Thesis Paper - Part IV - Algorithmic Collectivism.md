# PART III — A Proposal: Algorithmic Collectivism

> "It is the nameless collective and the procedures by which it is governed, which in the end prevail over the necessarily biased and single-minded individual. Yet, at the same time, the individual's ability to contribute to this communal process of the production of knowledge has never been greater." —comment from Anonymous contributor in preparation of op-ed for Guardian (Coleman)

I see an opportunity for an experience of the individual online that is completely engulfed within the collective. What does a social network without individuality look like?

Facebook and Anonymous sit at two ends of a spectrum of collective experiences online: Facebook is a very structured space where the individual is transparent and obvious; Anonymous, on the other hand, is an unstructured, rhizomatic network where the individual is obscured in anonymity. 

I am proposing a highly structured network (a la Facebook), but one where the individual is obscured; they remain, in a way, anonymous. The smallest entity, or node, in this network is a cluster of individuals; an algorithmic representation of the collective individual 'members' of that cluster.

## Algorithmic Collectivism

This "Algorithmic Crowd," although made up of multiple 'input' individuals, is a different entity. It is embodied in the algorithm that generates it, and yet is not entirely defined by that algorithm—requiring the crowd's input. In many ways it exists as a new entity. Each individual contributes but the algorithm collates, generates and defines the group identity.  Constituent individuals make active and ongoing contributions; but their ability to perceive themselves or others is obscured, only the collective crowd can be perceived.

Although there is a form of anonymity for the constituent individuals in this system, it may better be described as a shared identity. Their input, data or self-representation is present, but it is obscured as it becomes part of the new shared, collective identity. An individual may perhaps be able to link aspects of the algorithmic identity back to their own contributions, and so may not define it as complete anonymity, but they are not explicitly identifiable as present within the merged entity.

### Inhabiting Demographics

Facebook perceives users as demographics. What would it be for the demographic to be the interface or experience for the user? The individual can only experience themselves as part of a collective; the background demographics are brought to the front. Deleuze's dividual is designed into the foreground:

> "Instead of whole individuals, we are constituted in multiple micro-publics, inhabitants of simultaneously overlapping telecocoons, sharing telepresence with intimates in whom we are in near-constant touch, members of… clustered demographic units." (Varnelis)

## Obscuring perception of self-/individual-

Lanier argues that "emphasising the crowd means de-emphasising individual humans in the design of society, and when you ask people not to be people, they revert to bad mob-like behaviours." I want to design-out the opportunity for this. Central to this Algorithmic Collectivism is inhibiting the ability to directly represent yourself or perceive the individual other. Without the ability to relate as an individual, the individual capacity to influence directly is quashed.

The result is a collaborative model where the individual can't be perceived, so they can't explicitly lead the group; a mob mentality without the influence of one. Each person contributes to the whole, but can't explicitly direct or represent the whole group.

### The Experience of Losing Oneself in the Crowd

One might ask, with this sacrificing of capability to perceive or represent oneself directly, why would anyone want to participate in such a system? Would the individual limit them-self to experience the collective? I think there is evidence in current systems for this limiting of self to partake in something. On Facebook, for example, you actively choose to sacrifice particular liberties (i.e. privacy, control) to be part of a larger collective experience. The user also, as previously discussed, limits how they are represented to the format and structures of Facebook.

In trying to achieve a dissolution into a group that is not negative, I am primarily interested in the *experience* of self in this collective setting. How can you interface as an individual through an interaction with the collective in which you loose yourself? Removing the individualistic self, what is that like to experience to collective or shared self? What freedom or escape might be possible from the agendas I've previously outlined? I'm interested in what the experience of connectedness might feel like, mediated through these technological interfaces.

Freud uses the term "oceanic feeling" in an attempt to define the psychological feeling of religion. A person experiences this emotion when they have a sense of being continuous with the rest of the universe. He describes it as “a feeling of an indissoluble bond, of being one with the external world as a whole” (12). He theorises that this experience of being connected beyond the self, is "a vestige of infantile consciousness prior to the time when the infant begins to distinguish himself from his human and non-human environment," (Roberts) a time before the self has formed for the infant. Might it be possible to experience something similar when interacting in a subversive, augmented reality that inhibits you from perceiving yourself—perhaps enabling moments of bypassing the limits of the self?

In designing interactions with an Algorithmic Collective, I am interested in creating such experiences that might enable individuals to feel this "oceanic" connectedness with the collective.[<sup>1</sup>](#1)

## Answering The Surveillance Question

*{EDIT NOTE: Maybe not important for the paper, or maybe needs to be expanded and further integrated?}*

Privacy and surveillance are obviously major themes in understanding the self in these new 'public' spaces. This isn't something I've addressed directly, but I do believe that Algorithmic Collectivism offers a particular perspective.

The concept of private data is an oxymoron in these shared spaces. How can the individual expect to remain the 'owner' of themselves and their data if they willing hand it over to corporations, with their own economic agendas, to be represented pseudo-public spaces. Anonymous are a group who have particularly set out to expose private data in these spaces as a myth.

> "Anonymous [has] deflated the notion that such a thing as "private information" exists, as opposed to information in the public sphere. This distinction is one of the foundations of the neoliberal state, the very means by which individuality in constituted—and tracked. Anonymous has made it clear that there's no difference between what we imagine to be our private and public selves—between singular individuals and fragment "dividual," in Gilles Deleuze's terms." (Coleman)

Numerous thinkers and makers have explored how these ideas might be exposed and subverted. Steve Mann's concept of sousveillance, where the individual surveils themselves and publicises the output, questions the very basis of presenting oneself in these spaces by freely making the Self available, accessible, and own-able by the other. In a way, it is a form of Self-commodifying that offers an avenue of undermining these systems on their own terms. The Neoliberal agenda and understanding of individual is turned on its head by being fully played out.

Sousveillance could be understood as a reversal of Foucault's Panopticon, where one watches the many, to a situation where many watch each one. My proposal offers an alternative mode of engagement—with a similar result. If the one is concealed in a collective—where information is collated before being uploaded—they avoid both the eyes of the one and the many.

Perhaps these new Algorithmic Collective entities will need to be formed in a physical interaction involving multiple participants before the collated result is uploaded, and the original individual data is destroyed. A system like this could be designed to avoid such surveillance through this new model of Collective Self, and might indicate another motivation for involvement in such a system.

1. <span id="1"> Freud </span> was primarily reflecting upon religious and ecstatic experience. I am, for the time being, content to included those connotations in my use of the term. Religious practice has often been built around collective rituals in which we collectively experience the sublime—what I am designing in Algorithmic Collectivism seems to share a number of similar elements.
