# PART III — A Proposal: Algorithmic Collectivism

> "It is the nameless collective and the procedures by which it is governed, which in the end prevail over the necessarily biased and single-minded individual. Yet, at the same time, the individual's ability to contribute to this communal process of the production of knowledge has never been greater." —comment from Anonymous contributor in preparation of op-ed for Guardian (Coleman)

I see an opportunity for an experience of the individual online that is completely within the collective. What does a social network without individuality look like?

Facebook and Anonymous sit at two ends of a spectrum of collective experiences online: Facebook is a very structured space where the individual is transparent and obvious; Anonymous, on the other hand, is an unstructured, rhizomatic network where the individual is obscured in anonymity. 

I am proposing a highly structured network (a la Facebook), but one where the individual is obscured; they remain, in a way, anonymous. The smallest entity, or node, in this network is a cluster of individuals; an algorithmic representation of the collective individual 'members' of that cluster.

## Algorithmic Collectivism

This "Algorithmic Crowd," although made up of individual inputs, is a different entity. It is embodied in the algorithm that generates it, and yet is separate from it—requiring the crowd's input. In many ways it exists as a new entity. Each individual is contributing but the algorithm collates, generates and defines the group identity. -a new, different form of collective 'production'-  Constituent individuals make active and ongoing contributions; but their ability to perceive themselves or others is obscured, only the collective crowd can be perceived. -It is not a noosphere or a being that exists in the ether, but there is something unique about it.-

Although there is a form of anonymity for the constituent individuals in this system, it may better be described as a shared identity. Their input and self-representations/data is present, but it is obscured as it has become part of the new shared, collective identity. Perhaps an individual may be able to link aspects of the algorithmic identity back to their own contributions, and so may not define it as complete anonymity, but they are not explicitly present / identifiable within the merged entity.

## Inhabiting Demographics

Facebook perceives/understands users through demographics. What would it be for the demographic to be the interface/experience for the user? These background demographics are brought to the foreground.

Reminiscent (?) of Deleuze's dividual: "Instead of whole individuals, we are constituted in multiple micro-publics, inhabitants of simultaneously overlapping telecocoons, sharing telepresence with intimates in whom we are in near-constant touch, members of… clustered demographic units." (Varnelis)

## Obscuring perception of self-/individual-

Central to this Algorithmic Collectivism is the removal/inhibiting to ability to directly represent yourself or perceive the individual other…

Without the individual ability to relate, you remove the individual ability to influence… Commenting/trolling
A collaborative model where you can't perceive the individual, so they can't explicit influence/lead the group. A mob mentality without the influence of one. Each person contributes to the whole, but can't explicitly influence the whole group.

Lanier argues that "emphasising the crowd means de-emphasising individual humans in the design of society, and when you ask people not to be people, they revert to bad mob-like behaviours." I want to design-out the ability/opportunity for this.

### The Experience of Losing Oneself in the Crowd

One might ask, with the sacrificing of control/ability to perceive/represent oneself directly, why would anyone want to participate in such a system?

In trying to achieve a dissolution into a group that is not negative, I am primarily interested in the *experience* of self in this collective setting. How can you interface as an individual through an interaction with the collective in which you loose yourself?

Limiting the self to experience to experience the collective. Facebook, you actively choose to restrict/sacrifice particular liberties (i.e. privacy) to be part of a larger collective/experience. Limiting how you represent yourself. Remove the individualistic self, to experience to collective/shared self—what is that like? Freedom/escape from economic or other agendas.

I'm interested in what the experience of connectedness might feel like, mediated through these technological interfaces.

Freud (1930) uses the term "oceanic feeling" in an attempt to define the psychological feeling of religion. A person experiences this emotion when they have a sense of being continuous with the rest of the universe. He describes it as “a feeling of an indissoluble bond, of being one with the external world as a whole” (p. 12). 

He theorises that this experience of being connected beyond the self, is "a vestige of infantile consciousness prior to the time when the infant begins to distinguish himself from his human and non-human environment," (Roberts) a time before the self has formed for the infant. Might it be possible to experience something similar when interacting in a subversive, augmented reality that inhibits you from perceiving yourself—perhaps enabling moments of bypassing the limits of the self? In designing interactions with an Algorithmic Collective, I am interested in creating such experiences that might enable individuals to feel this "oceanic" connectedness with the collective.

[ -MAKE FOOTNOTE- ] Freud was primarily reflecting upon religious and ecstatic experience. I am, for the time being, content to included those connotations in my use of the term. Religious practice has often been built around collective rituals in which we collectively experience the sublime—what I am designing in Algorithmic Collectivism seems to share a number of similar elements. 

## Answering The Surveillance Question

Privacy and Surveillance is obviously a major factor in understanding the self in these new 'public' spaces. This isn't something I've addressed directly, but I do want to situate Algorithmic Collectivism within this debate. [ -MAYBE NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE PAPER, OR MAYBE NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED AND FURTHER INTEGRATED?- ]

Part + parcel -> private data is an oxymoron in these shared spaces.

Anonymous quote ->

> "Anonymous [has] deflated the notion that such a thing as "private information" exists, as opposed to information in the public sphere. This distinction is one of the foundations of the neoliberal state, the very means by which individuality in constituted—and tracked. Anonymous has made it clear that there's no difference between what we imagine to be our private and public selves—between singular individuals and fragment "dividual," in Gilles Deleuze's terms." (Coleman)

Steve Mann's Sousveillance -> very basis of presenting oneself in these spaces is making your self/information available/owned/accessible by other. Commodifying the self. (Hasan Elahi)

Neoliberal agenda / understanding of individual

My proposal offers an alternative mode of engagement.

Reversing the Panopticon, where the one watches the many… now in a situation where each one is watched by many. If the one is concealed in a collective—where information is collated before being uploaded—they avoid both the eyes of the one and the many.

Why these new entities should be formed in the physical and uploaded (individual data destroyed in process) -> to avoid such surveillance 

Proposal moving forward…

## Quorum Sensing?? Critical Mass?

## Demographic Resolution

**Initiation:** Physical representation of this initiation/registration. You would go through this experience/ritual together and a new entity would emerge to inhabit the network.

**Quorum sensing:** A representation of the collective that is only unlocked when a certain number of people are present.

**Decisions / Opt-in** The point where you choose to submit yourself to the system. With Facebook, you choose to contribute with every post/comment. Perhaps in this system, you make the decision earlier on to join a group, and then have less influence about what/how/when you contribute? You registration is the one opt-in decision.
