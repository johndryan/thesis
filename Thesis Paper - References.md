**Coleman, G. (2012) *Our Weirdness Is Free*. May, 9.**

Coleman is an anthropologist who researches hackers and digital activism. This paper explores the history, logic and ethos behind Anonymous, the hacktivist group. Her insight and theories about the group have been most useful in exploring an example of a networked collective, consisting of multiple individuals, that is decentralised, leaderless and has anonymous 'membership'. In particular she identities Anonymous's agenda to counter the possessive capitalist individualism predominant on the web.

**De Certeau, M. (1984) *The Practice of Everyday Life*. Berkeley: University of California.**
De Certeau's important text examines how mass culture is individualised as we make it our own. Of particular relevance to this paper is his distinction between what he identifies as strategies and tactics. He defines strategies as the methods and structures used by institutions to impose power, whereas tactics are the ways in which individuals negotiate these structures, adapting them and making them "habitable." I understand this as particularly applicable when considering the strictly defined and controlled architecture of social networks, from the individualising schemas to the interface itself, and the ways in which we can—and do—negotiate these to make them our own.

**Dean, J. (2009) *Democracy and Other Neoliberal Fantasies: Communicative Capitalism and Left Politics*. Durham, NC: Duke University Press Books.**
Dean assesses a number of ideologies and trends in contemporary political culture, but the chapters on technology and its relationship with neoliberalism were particularly applicable to my research. She coins the phrase "communicative capitalism" to describe what she sees as a mix of consumerism and the privileging of the individual over the collective that has become predominant in social media and other similar spheres.

**Deleuze, G. (1992) *Postscript on the Societies of Control*. October, 59 p.3-7.**

Deleuze describes a transition from Foucault's "disciplinary societies" to what he calls "societies of control." In discussing the technologies of continuous control, he describes the concept of the "dividual"—the human individual now reduced and divided endlessly into data representations by computer-based systems. Rather than individual, the constituent data of the deconstructed dividual is what is of value in this contemporary capitalism. Deleuze's dividual is exemplified in the data-mining agendas of social networks.

I use this review of the Hansen's and Rubin's *Listening Post*, in referencing as described below. In particular, Eleey's description of the piece as simultaneous collapsing and expanding individual thought and group dynamics."

**Freud, S. (1930) *Civilisation and Its Discontents*. London.**

Freud examines the tensions between the individual and society, examining the contrasting forces of freedom and conformity. Early on, he uses the term "oceanic feeling" in an attempt to define the psychological feeling of religion. A person experiences this emotion when they have a sense of being continuous with the rest of the universe. He describes it as “a feeling of an indissoluble bond, of being one with the external world as a whole.” (1930) He theorises that this experience of being connected beyond the self, is "a vestige of infantile consciousness prior to the time when the infant begins to distinguish himself from his human and non-human environment" (Roberts); a time before the self has formed for the infant. In terms of the experience design of my work, I use this concept to ask how something similar might be experienced when interacting in a subversive, augmented reality that inhibits you from perceiving yourself—perhaps enabling moments of bypassing the limits of the self?

**Galloway, A. (2004) *Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization*. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press**.

Although Galloway focusses on the technical description of the  architecture present in the network, he uses this as the basis to discuss its political and ideological ramifications. He argues that control, and not freedom, lies at the heart of the Internet's development and structure—particularly as embodies in the protocols that make the network possible. He goes on to describe the various cultures and communities that have developed around, and in response to, the nature of these protocols.

**Grosser, B. (2012) *Demetricator*. [online] Available at: http://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/ [Accessed: 7 Jan 2013].**

Ben Grosser's Demetricator explicitly seeks to remove one important element in the market ideology of Facebook through removing the metrics constantly displayed to the user that "measure and present our social value and activity, enumerating friends, likes, comments, and more." It is a web browser add-on that hides these metrics: '36 people like this' becomes 'people like this' and 'having 105 friends' becomes simply 'having friends.'

> "Demetricator invites Facebook’s users to try the system without the numbers, to see how their experience is changed by their absence. With this work I aim to disrupt the prescribed sociality these metrics produce, enabling a network society that isn’t dependent on quantification." (Grosser, 2012)

**Hansen, M. and Rubin, B. (2001) *Listening Post*.**

I use this artwork as an example of work that seeks to represent and interact with the Internet in a more collectivising way. It is an installation that pulls text fragments mentioning the phrase "I am…" from thousands of chat rooms in real time. These extracts are then displayed on a suspended grid of over 200 small liquid-crystal displays, while at the same time being read by a computer-generated voice. It offers an interesting contrast between the literal individualism of these "I am" conversational extracts and the collective experience of engaging with them all simultaneously. Its format offers both a dissolution of the text from its author and original context, along with multiplexing it into a coherent collective whole.

**Harvey, D. (2005) *A Brief History of Neoliberalism*. Oxford: Oxford University Press.**

Harvey's book served as a historical and ideological overview of  neoliberalism, "the doctrine that market exchange is an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide for all human action." His writing provided historical context and identified key concepts which I have applied to the social media realm.

**Horning, R. (2012) Hi Haters!. *The New Inquiry*, Available at: http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/hi-haters [Accessed: 30 Nov 2012].**

Horning's opinion piece covers the social-media-fuelled trends of micro fame, self-marketing, and self-surveillance. He draws links between them and neoliberalism, which served as starting points for some of my writing on the commodification of the individual.

**Lanier, J. (2011) *You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto*. New York: Vintage.**

Lanier, a computer scientist and pioneer of early digital media, critiques the role of digital design and its influence on society, particularly as embodied in the ideals of Web 2.0. He offers a counter-argument to my central thesis, suggesting that in social media we see an elevation of the "wisdom of the crowd," collectivism and the hive mind, over the "importance and uniqueness of the individual voice."

**Macpherson, C.B. (1962) *The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism*. Oxford: Clarendon Press.**

Macpherson's possessive individualism is defined as "those deeply internalized habits of thinking and feeling" whereby we view "everything around [us] primarily as actual or potential commercial property." He examines how this kind of individualism functions in the work of philosophers including Hobbes and Locke, and as a result pervades in the influence of liberalism from that point on. Macpherson's individual understands themselves, their skills, and those of others as a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market. At the core of possessive individualism lies an insatiable thirst for selfish consumption, which is considered central to human nature.

**Manovich, L. (2009) The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life: From Mass Consumption to Mass Cultural Production?. *Critical Inquiry*, 35 (2), p.319-331.**

Discussing "the explosion of user-created media content on the web" that he understands as the move "from media to social media," Manovich examines user-generated content by applying de Certeau's distinction "between strategies used by institutions and power structures and tactics used by modern subjects in their everyday lives." He discusses the changes that have taken places since de Certeau published his work, suggesting that "strategies and tactics are now often closely linked in an interactive relationship, and often their features are reversed." Because the strategies of social media are increasingly flexible (e.g. allowing greater user customisation), Manovich interprets this as appearing more like tactics. I disagree, interpreting this as a strategy for encouraging greater subjection to control.

**Treanor, P. (2005) *Neoliberalism: origins, theory, definition*. [online] Available at: http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/neoliberalism.html [Accessed: 1 Jan 2013].**

Treanor offers a broad definition and overview of neoliberalism, examining its origins in liberalism from the late 18th century, its application to the market in free trade, and neoliberalism's desire to expand beyond the market in every action, becoming more than an economic structure—closer to a philosophy.

**Varnelis, K. (2008) Conclusion: The Meaning of Network Culture. In: Varnelis, K. eds. (2008) *Networked Publics*. 1st ed. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, p.145-163.**

Reflecting on the influence of the network and information technology, Varnelis edits in this book a series of essays on what he calls "network culture." In this closing essay, he examines evidence for, and the affect of, network culture in various areas of contemporary life. In examining the subject of networked culture, he critiques a naive understanding of a nodal distributed model. Instead he offers his conception of "telecocoons," which is particularly useful: "Instead of whole individuals, we are constituted in multiple micro-publics, inhabitants of simultaneously overlapping telecocoons, sharing telepresence with intimates in whom we are in near-constant touch, members of… clustered demographic units." (Varnelis)

**Williams, R. (2005) Politics and Self in the Age of Digital Re(pro)ducibility. *Fast Capitalism*, 1 (1), Available at: http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/1_1/williams.html [Accessed: 30 Nov. 2012].**

Williams discusses the influence of "globalizing capitalism and liberal-democratic policies" on Western concepts of the self. He problematises the individuality of the self, asking "how distinctly and utterly "individual" is the self?" Consumer corporations and liberal-democratic governments hail the Individual as their rallying cry, but Williams questions "how autonomous, sacrosanct, and centered is the individual when autonomy is defined as choosing from pre-selected political or consumer choices" as defined by these same groups. In examining the relationship between technology and society, he heavily references and builds on Deleuze's concept of the "dividual" along with the Frankfurt School's applications of cultural Marxist theory.

**Woods, J. (2012) *Why User-Centered Design is Not Enough*. [online] Available at: http://www.core77.com/blog/articles/why_user-centered_design_is_not_enough_by_john_wood_23465.asp [Accessed: 2 Jan 2013].**

Woods' critique of User-Centered Design questions how useful humanism and person-centred consumerism is as underlying philosophies for design. He suggests that they have lead us towards a design that is narcissistic and solipsistic. He suggests the adoption of richer, multi-approach models for design that might allow us to "innovate at a more strategic, self-reflexive level."
