**Coleman, G. (2012) *Our Weirdness Is Free*. May, 9.**

Coleman is an anthropologist who researches hackers and digital activism. This paper explores the history, logic and ethos behind Anonymous, the hacktivist group. Her insight and theories about the group have been most useful in exploring an example of a networked collective consisting of multiple individuals that is decentralised, leaderless and anonymous 'membership'. In particular she identities Anonymous's agenda to counter the possessive capitalist individualism predominate on the web.

**De Certeau, M. (1984) *The Practice of Everyday Life*. Berkeley: University of California.**
De Certeau's important text examines how mass culture is individualised as we make it our on. Of particular relevance to this paper, is his distinction between what he identifies as strategies and tactics. He defines strategies as the methods and structures used by institutions to impose power, whereas tactics are the ways in which the individuals negotiates these structures, adapting them and making them "habitable". I understand this as particularly applicable when considering the strictly defined and controlled architecture of social networks, from the individualising schemas to the interface itself, and the ways in which we can—and do—negotiate these to make them our own.

**Dean, J. (2009) *Democracy and Other Neoliberal Fantasies: Communicative Capitalism and Left Politics*. Durham, NC: Duke University Press Books.**
Dean assess a number of ideologies and trends in contemporary political culture, but the chapters on technology and its relationship with neoliberalism were particularly applicable to my research. She coins the phrase "communicative capitalism" to describe what she see as a mix of consumerism and the privileging of the individual over the collective that has become predominant in social media and other similar spheres.

**Deleuze, G. (1992) *Postscript on the Societies of Control*. October, 59 p.3-7.**

Deleuze describes transition from Foucault's "disciplinary societies" to what Deleuze calls "societies of control."
In discussing the technologies of continuous control, he describes the concept of the "dividual"—the human individual now reduced and divided endlessly into data representations by computer-based systems. Rather than individual, the constituent data of the deconstructed dividual is what is of value in this contemporary capitalism. Deleuze's dividual is exemplified in the data-mining agendas of social networks.

I use this review of the Hansen's and Rubin's *Listening Post*, in referencing as described below. In particular, Eleey's description of the piece as simultaneous collapsing and expanding individual thought and group dynamics."

**Freud, S. (1930) *Civilisation and Its Discontents*. London.**

Freud examines the tensions between the individual and society, examining the contrasting forces of freedom and conformity. Early on, he uses the term "oceanic feeling" in an attempt to define the psychological feeling of religion. A person experiences this emotion when they have a sense of being continuous with the rest of the universe. He describes it as “a feeling of an indissoluble bond, of being one with the external world as a whole.” (1930) He theorises that this experience of being connected beyond the self, is "a vestige of infantile consciousness prior to the time when the infant begins to distinguish himself from his human and non-human environment" (Roberts); a time before the self has formed for the infant. In terms of the experience design of my work, I use this concept to ask howsomething similar might be experienced when interacting in a subversive, augmented reality that inhibits you from perceiving yourself—perhaps enabling moments of bypassing the limits of the self?

**Galloway, A. (2004) *Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization*. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press**.

Although Galloway focusses on the technical description of the  architecture present in the network, he uses this as the basis to discuss its political and ideological ramifications. He argues that control, and not freedom, lies at the heart of the Internet's development and structure—particularly as embodies in the protocols that make the network possible. He goes on to describe the various cultures and communities that have developed around and in response to the nature of these protocols.

**Grosser, B. (2012) *Demetricator*. [online] Available at: http://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/ [Accessed: 7 Jan 2013].**

Ben Grosser's [Demetricator](http://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/) explicitly seeks to remove one important element in the market ideology of Facebook through removing the metrics constantly displayed to the user that "measure and present our social value and activity, enumerating friends, likes, comments, and more." It is a web browser add-on that hides these metrics: '36 people like this' becomes 'people like this' and 'having 105 friends' becomes simply 'having friends.'

> "Demetricator invites Facebook’s users to try the system without the numbers, to see how their experience is changed by their absence. With this work I aim to disrupt the prescribed sociality these metrics produce, enabling a network society that isn’t dependent on quantification." (Grosser, 2012)

**Hansen, M. and Rubin, B. (2001) *Listening Post*.**

I use this artwork as an example of work that seeks to represent and interact with the Internet in a more collectivising way. It is an installation that pulls text fragments mentioning the phrase "I am…" from thousands of chat rooms in real time. These extracts are then displayed on a suspended grid of over 200 small liquid-crystal displays, while at the same time being read by a computer-generated voice. It offers an interesting contrast between the literal individualism of these "I am" conversational extracts and the collective experience of engaging with them all simultaneously. Its format offers both a dissolution of the text from its author and original context, along with multiplexing it into a coherent collective whole.
