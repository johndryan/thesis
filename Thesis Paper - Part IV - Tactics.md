# 3 - POTENTIAL + PROPOSAL

The Internet is a place ideally suited to an alt experience of the social, one that is more collective than individual-focussed.

## Perceptions of Being Part of Something Bigger
Individualism, as described in the previous section, obviously influences our perception and understanding of this. Even though the web is, as I've argued, a place where a particular ideological understanding of the Individual is perpetuated, it is also one sphere where people have a sense of being part of something larger than themselves. That is one of the most exciting aspects about the potential of the Internet for me.

On the Internet, people perceive themselves as being part of online communities in various forms (be they ones that may be uniquely framed with them at the centre). The Internet is in many ways perceived as the ultimate 'public sphere'.[<sup>1</sup>](#1)


Numerous works seek to explore the collective nature of the web

work which seeks to move away from the marketplace neoliberal agendas/values:
## Existing works: Listening post / bit.fall / etc.
Illustrate the net, but don't make us part of it?
work which seeks to create an experience with the collective / represent the "collective consciousness"

Ben grosser's demetricator, explicitly seeks to remove the market language of Facebook through removing numbers…

My projects: Facebook anonymizer. 


In my work, I want to take this further through creating technologically-mediated social spaces that interface with the collective, and not between multiple individuals. In this network, the smallest node is not individual but a collective.

Other cultural references?!

> "I feel that I am part of a larger thing, the Net, the Web. The world. It becomes a thing to me, a thing I am part of. And the people, too, I stop seeing them as individuals, really. They are part of this larger thing." — Interview with college student (Turkle 168)

-> "The digital hive is growing at the expense of individuality." (Lanier pp)-


Systems? -This idea of a system existing on a individual and collective level. With recent cultural shifts towards individualism, could be an interesting way to explore ethical egoism and ethical altruism. I am also interested in the way that a system exists on two interdependent levels; on an individual and collective level—"interdependent components forming an integrated whole." We exist concurrently as individuals and as nodes in networks at multiple levels: family, community, regional, national. Systems are at play from the micro—cells that make up the organs that make up our bodies—to the macro—the societies that make up humanity which itself is part of a global ecosystem.-

-Due to the structures of the web, but particularly because of inherent ideological agendas, we are primarily dealt with as collectives (consumed as *dividuals* into them), although rarely addressed as such. IS there another way to understand/know/experience this. Web users increasingly perceive themselves as part of a larger 'online community'.-

MODELS? Anonymous, etc.?

But I also see a positive potential in this. What about the joy of perceiving oneself in the collective? Perhaps the experience  is desirable? Maybe this multi-Self-fragmentation offers some new collective intimacy? Perhaps there is a new Collaborative Self to be cultivated: one which asks the collective to form an opinion for us: thinking out-loud and online; reflecting in the cloud.

**Furthermore, in this obscuring of the Self amidst the fragments, there lies the potential to encourage and enable a kind of individuality beyond possessive Western Individualism.** 

leveraging dividuals:

> "Instead of whole individuals, we are constituted in multiple micro-publics, inhabitants of simultaneously overlapping telecocoons, sharing telepresence with intimates in whom we are in near-constant touch, members of… clustered demographic units." (Varnelis)


Individual-user focussed design approach, Woods suggests multi-path… see Core77 article METADESIGN



Durkheim's Collective consciousness, not in a hive mind, but "a set of shared beliefs and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society."

Translated as collective perception / awareness

# PROPOSAL

> In a world where we post the majority of our personal data online, and states and corporations wield invasive tools to collect and market the rest, there is something profoundly hopeful in… effacement of the self… [It] enables participants to practice a kind of individuality beyond… "possessive individualism," defined as "those deeply internalized habits of thinking and feeling" whereby we view "everything around [us] primarily as actual or potential commercial property." (Varnelis)

-Across the axes that I have outlined above, I see a fascinating complex, cohesive, and multiplexed[<sup>2</sup>](#2) self; an incredibly rich ground for research and design in this understanding of the digital-physical self.-

Why do I propose this?

**In designing interactions with an Algorithmic Collective, I am interested in creating such experiences that might enable individuals to feel this "oceanic" connectedness with the collective.** See more in Part IV of last draft

redundant, decentralized, peer-to-peer

<span id="2">Multiplexed Self</span> "In telecommunications and computer networks, multiplexing (also known as muxing) is a method by which multiple analog message signals or digital data streams are combined into one signal over a shared medium." ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing)) I see this as an apt metaphor for describing the persistent, co-located self. *{EDIT NOTE: Perhaps I will expand upon this in the main body of text? I've already added it to an updated paper title.}*

I see an opportunity for an experience of the individual online that is completely engulfed within the collective; a social network without individuality.

Facebook and Anonymous sit at two ends of a spectrum of collective experiences online: Facebook is a highly structured space where the Individual is transparent and obvious; Anonymous, on the other hand, is an unstructured, rhizomatic network where the Individual is obscured in anonymity. 

I am proposing a highly structured network (a la Facebook), but one where the Individual is obscured; they remain, in a way, anonymous. The smallest entity, or node, in this network is a cluster of Individuals; an algorithmic representation of the collective individual 'members' of that cluster.

#### De Certeau?

What are the collective *tactics* that might be deployed within the individual-focussed/-enforcing/-empowering *strategies* of these networks?

> Strategies are able to produce, tabulate, and impose these spaces… whereas tactics can only use, manipulate and divert [them]. (De Certeau, 30)

##### "subverting them from within"

How might one trace "indeterminate trajectories that are apparently meaningless, since they do not cohere with the constructed, written, and prefabricated space through which they  move." (De Certeau 35)

> De Certeau makes a distinction between strategies used by institutions and power structures and tactics used by modern subjects in their everyday lives. The tactics are the ways in which individuals negotiate strategies that were set for them. (Manovich)
> …  In other words, an individual can’t physically reorganize the city, but he or she can adapt it to his or her needs by choosing how to move through it. A tactic “expects to have to work on things in order to make them its own, or to make them ‘habitable.’”9

> “Unlike the strategy, it [the tac- tic] lacks the centralized structure and permanence that would enable it to set itself up as a competitor to some other entity. . . . It renders its own activities an ‘unmappable’ form of subversion”

Entities like Anonymous which are tactical collective entities existing inside the strategic, standardised presences of the web's protocols, social networks and communication channels.

Has the tactical become strategic?

Tactic: De Certeau defines “tactics” as ways to artfully “use, manipulate, and divert” the cultural products and spaces imposed by an external power.

Do we lack direct presence? Benjamin's *aura* as we become reproducible and assessable to many?
