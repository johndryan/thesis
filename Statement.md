## Deposing User Sovereignty in the Protocols of the New Social Hyper-State

### (A Declaration of Interdepedence)

Since Hobbes' Leviathan, Locke's Second Treatise, and Smith's Wealth of Nations, the individual (her self-interest, self-preservation and self-ownership) has become the fundamental component of political, economic and social systems. The agency of the individual has been embedded unquestioningly as the node-level building blocks of the systems we inhabit: interfaces, networks, nations…

The Internet was to usher in a new era—disrupting boundaries at every scale from the Westphalian state to the Lockean Self—and creating utopian conditions for a cybernetic post-individualism: collective consciousness, the global brain.

Instead, the contemporary Internet is a Frankenstein creature:   globally-connected collectivism awkwardly fused with neoliberal individualism. Numerous fracture-points show this experiment's failings; these competing philosophies are far from congruent. We are more 'interconnected' than ever before but our interactions and experiences are discretely individual: radically tailored and meticulously bespoke.

Instead of moving us away from an individual-focussed Classical Liberalism, the dawn of the Information Age have instead placed the individual at the centre of a new economics of information, where personal information and self-expression are the new currency, and market-practices are applied to social relations. Emerging from the feudal and then hierarchical, we have not yet reached the distributed, egalitarian ideal the Network promised. Instead, this individual-centred-collectivism repositions the self/citizen/user/agent as the pivotal hub with spokes reaching out into their version of the network, interconnecting with other individuals and systems, other hubs and spokes. Each overlaps and interconnects, providing every node with a perspective of connectedness that is centred around them.

This ubiquitous foregrounding of the *I*, anecdotally captured in Apple's product-naming (iPod, iPhone, iLife, etc.), is present at every level of the network stack, from social profile to selfish interface to solipsistic device. Steve Job's Leviathan sees the sovereign consumer reigning over their own bespoke version of reality; a representation of the 'social' that is uniquely bespoke, serving the individual user's tastes and desires. Increasingly, we are the technocratic monarch of our own personalised leviathan, with the *freedom* and ability to govern and manage our social interactions, access infinite technical infrastructure at our beck-and-call, and leverage real-time analytics for every-and-any-thing-as-dataset.

<del>User-Centred Design, which has become central to much contemporary design thinking, centres the design process around needs and desires of the end-user. In doing so, it embeds this neoliberal understanding of the individual into these interactions and systems, positioning the individual user at the centre of their own bespoke reality (even in those spaces and interactions labelled as ‘social’).</del>

But beneath the selfish interface, lies complex networks of interdependent systems, structures, and, ultimately, people. Even though I can now view, order and receive a book from Amazon without directly interacting with one person, I am reliant on a larger number of people than ever before. My work asks how this invisible interdependence might be brought into the foreground?It speculates as to what these systems might look like without this philosophical and ideological foundation? As networked life expands beyond the screen into objects and places, I believe that it is crucial to explore tactical design that counteracts, disrupts, and offers alternatives to this technologically-embedded individualism. I endeavour to move towards a more collective experience of the technologically-mediated social, that doesn't understand the world through the lens of self-interest (perceiving a *user* who only possesses desires and preferences) but designs "systems that rely on engagement, communication, and a sense of common purpose and identity."
