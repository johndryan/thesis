## Overthrowing/Deposing User Sovereignty in the Protocols of the New Social Hyper-state

Since Hobbes' Leviathan, Locke's Second Treatise, and Smith's Wealth of Nations, the individual (her self-interest, self-preservation and self-owernship) has been the rudimentary and fundamental component of political, economic and social systems. The agency of the individual has been embedded unquestioningly at the node-level building blocks of the systems we inhabit: interfaces, networks, nations…

The Internet was to usher in a new era—erasing boundaries at every level from the Westphalian state to the Lockean Self—and creating utopian conditions for collective experience and the hive mind.

Instead, the contemporary Internet is a Frankenstein creature:   globally-connected collectivism awkwardly fused with neoliberal individualism. Numerous fracture-points show this experiment's failings; these competing philosophies are not as congruent as we might think/hope within these systems. 

Job's Leviathan continues the "i" before all else:
