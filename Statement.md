# Designing Agency
## Dissolving User Sovereignty in the Networked Social (A Declaration of Interdepedence)

- - -

Since Hobbes' *Leviathan*, Locke's *Second Treatise*, and Smith's *Wealth of Nations*, the individual (her self-interest, self-ownership, and self-agency) has been embedded unquestioningly as the node-level building block of the systems we inhabit: interfaces, networks, nations…

The Internet was to usher in a new era — disrupting boundaries at every scale from the Westphalian state to the Lockean Self — and creating utopian conditions for a cybernetic post-individualism: collective consciousness, the global brain. 

Instead, the contemporary Internet is an ideological Frankenstein: globally-connected collectivism awkwardly fused with neoliberal individualism. We are more interconnected than ever before but our interactions and experiences are discretely individual: radically tailored and meticulously bespoke.

This *interdividualism* places the individual at the centre of a new economy of information, where personal data and self-expression become currency, and market-practices are applied to social relations. The self/citizen/user/agent is repositioned as the pivotal hub in their customised version of the network, which overlaps and interconnects with other network instances, providing every node with a perspective of connectedness that is centred around the individual.

This ubiquitous foregrounding of the *I*, anecdotally captured in Apple's product-naming (iPod, iPhone, iLife, etc.), is present at every level of the network stack, from social profile to selfish interface to solipsistic device. Steve Job's Leviathan sees the sovereign consumer reigning over their own personalised reality; a representation of the 'social' that uniquely serves their specific tastes and desires.

Challenging User-Centered Design's assumption that agency must always lie with the individual, my work speculates as to how networked devices, interfaces and systems might be designed with alternative ideological foundations. Incorporating collaborative, collective, and self-effacing interactions, a series of projects (injected at various points across the network stack) counteract, disrupt, and offer alternatives to a technologically-embedded individualism.
