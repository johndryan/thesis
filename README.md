# I AM HERE
## Presence, (Co-)Location and Identity	

What does it mean to be present _now_?

It seems to me that _now_ sees two equal appetites for presence, but in seemingly opposing ways: both a desire for embodied collective presence (occupation and protest, relational art/aesthetics, urban interventionism, flash mobs) as well as the disembodied augmented presence technology has enabled (social networks, geolocation, video conferencing, military drones, remote sensing). Co-location could be used to describe both, with its two contradictory meanings: ‘several entities present in a single location’ AND ‘a single entity present in several locations’.

A ‘here-ness’ hand-in-hand-with/battling-against an ‘everywhere-ness’. 

These two layers of presence are not mutually exclusive, but are interwoven and blurred in a myriad of ways: physical presence and happening amplified through the personal broadcasting of our experiences across various web ‘presences’; the familiar absence to physical surroundings caused by the constant tending to our online personas on now-ubiquitous connected devices; _[add more examples]_. 

An important element of this meshing is the technological mediation which connects, fuses, collides, and fractures multiple ‘presences’. This technological layer is perhaps popularly accepted as a passive medium through which much of this colocation takes place, but of course it is not. As Manovich describes, since this all takes place “on computers, distributed via computers, stored and archived on computers, the logic of a computer can be expected to [have] significant influence… That is, we may expect that the computer layer will affect the cultural layer.” (2002)

Personal identity, with its connections to both presence and place, is inextricably linked with this new interwoven data layer. In the midst of this presence complexity, what does individual identity look like? If our identities are informed by perception (what we [choose to] see and what we don’t) as well as how we in turn are perceived, in what ways does technology shape our identities and impose beliefs through what it filters—through what it makes visible and what it hides?  Who designs and controls these decisions? How does technology’s framing distort our experiences and perceptions, alter presence and absence, and affect our perceptions and identity? How might this mediation be exposed through emphasising, distorting or manipulating the machine layer?

Amidst all of this, the phrase “I am here” has a particular resonance for me—not just in describing presence, place, and context (in both the experience and broadcast layers)—but in the struggle to define identity in the midst of this complexity, the desire to leave a mark, to be known, to be present, to experience, to share experience… As today’s individual struggles with anonymity, legacy, and identity, will new modes of self-expression emerge?

How might designed objects and interactions expose, critique or distort the perceptual Faraday Cage of the technological layer? How might such interventions or interactions amplify the ‘present-ness’ of the presence or define new modes of presence? How might they sever presence, creating new expressions of disconnected absence?
