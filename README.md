# Computation, Ritual and (Dis)Connection

#### Thesis Statement of Interest — Working Draft — Week 1

## Ritual + Connection

For millennia, we’ve used ritual, story and myth to understand and explain the incredibly complex world around us. Rituals have connected us with our inner (embodied cognitive functions linked with intuition, memory and belief) and outer worlds (the larger communities, systems and landscapes we inhabit). Micro-habits and sub-routines provide comfort and control in the midst of the unknown, forming “a vast, often unseen universe of small rituals that accompany us through every waking hour of a day”. (Carey, 2007) Shared rituals provide the relational infrastructure for intimate personal relationships, everyday social interactions, and cultural and political institutions.

## Code == Ritual

I am fascinated by the parallels between ritual and code. Both can be described as a series of symbolic actions performed according to a prescribed order. Both technical protocols and shared rituals evolve, becoming codified over time. In a similar manner to the reuse of structured blocks of code in computing, we are cognitively hard-wired to form, and find meaning in, repeated ritualistic behaviours.

## Connected_Objects{};

Objects have long played a central role in our individual and collective rituals—connecting us with our spatial surroundings—but new computationally-driven and -derived objects are connecting us in new ways. Ubiquitous objects that interface between our world and the realm of code are providing us with new ways to connect with (and disconnect from):

- ourselves (online counselling, confessional iPhone apps)
- communities (social networking, new social rituals)
- our surroundings (geolocation, new digital layers to the city)
- larger systems and structures (the state, media, commerce)

Rituals that have previously connected us are now evolving to take place in this digital space. I am fascinated by our subjective experiences of this technologically-mediated threshold, particularly at the point of interaction between the procedures of code and the idiosyncratic rituals and routines of the person.

## New Array[] = Research_Questions[];

- What new rituals are emerging from the ubiquitous computational interactions that we now experience?
- What occurs when we take the subjective, the peculiar and the personal and force them into rigid digital structures?
- How do technological rituals, patterns and routines provide us with meaning and identity at both an individual and societal level?
- How can our idiosyncratic rituals inform designed interactions that disrupt our increasingly ordered and systemized lives, introducing opportunities for meaning-making and serendipity?
- Why do we cling to odd rituals that seem to make no sense? What are the idiosyncratic interactions that occur or might occur with technology in a similar way?
- What do the nervous ticks and anxious compulsive habits of the digital era look like?
- How is computational connectedness transforming our rituals and routines of movement in the city?
- How might ritual interactions inform interactions with technology that are more experiential/holistic/sublime?
- How might such interactions provoke reexamination of our relationships with technology and design, encouraging questioning of what it means to be human in an increasingly digitised and data-driven world?

## if (this.context) then Make();

As a designer, maker and programmer working in this context, my thesis research will bring together the key ideas outlined above to explore the point of interface between the digital and the personal as a place of ritual both in the interaction for the user but also in the ritual nature of code itself. My research will involve designing ritual interactions with computationally informed, derived or driven objects in order to subvert and recontextualize existing rituals and create new ones. I want to explore new modes of (re-/dis-)connection through distorting, inverting and recontextualizing the behavior of code and the behavior of the ‘user’.
