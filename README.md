Thesis Gateway Statement - First Draft
======================================

The dawn of the Digital Age has profoundly impacted our lives at both an individual and societal level. I believe the strict structures of computation have influenced the ways in which we think, relate and understand the world around us.

> “The most crucial fact about […] new technology is that it is not a separate domain (such as the label “high-tech” implies) but a set of changes that pervade all aspects of society and reorganize all older relationships.” (Bell, 1999. p. xxxvii)

Surrounding this concept, much of my work to date has explored the overlapping thresholds between three dichotomies: (1) the Digital and the Physical, (2) the Private and the Public, and (3) the Ordered and the Chaotic.

1. The Digital meeting the Physical could be defined as our everyday experience of the electronic, which is ultimately embodied in the devices that surround us. I am excited by the possibilities of emerging mixed-realities as an interplay between the complexity of humanity and the simplicity of the data’s binary nature. What complexities are lost when interactions are reduced to ones and zeros?
2. The interface between the Private and the Public refers to the interconnections that exist between the individual and the communities of which they are a part. How is society at large affected by the increasing mediation of relationships through screen-based devices instead of face-to-face? Are new social structures emerging through networked interactions that supersede those born out of locality and place?
3. Finally, in the context of our data-saturated world, I feel that concepts of Order and Chaos will offer new ways for examining and designing the interactions between the strict structures of the digital world and the organic fluid nature of the physical world. Historically, ordered-chaotic dualities have been central to many religions and mythologies. How might similar concepts add weight to our new interactions and inform new myths of the digital age? How can design disrupt our increasingly ordered and systemized lives, introducing disorder, chaos and serendipity in a designed way?

Objects and rituals have reappeared in my recent work and I believe they will be valuable modes to play with at this unique combination of thresholds. We experience the Digital through physical objects —screens, devices, machines— and networked objects offering new ways of making the Digital tangible. Rituals are those practices, habits and patterns we engage in to find meaning and comfort. I’m intrigued by the ways in which they help us to create order in chaos and find meaning in life’s complexities. They are central to social interactions and new technologies have given birth to new rituals both in the Private and the Public spheres. What are these rituals of the computer age and how might they be explored in object form?

My initial thesis projects and experiments will explore translation, emergence and disruption through objects and rituals at the common interface between the Digital and the Physical, the Public and the Private, and the Ordered and the Chaotic. I’m inspired in this by how Order and Chaos are both translated from one to the other in unique ways; disruption moves us from order towards chaos, and emergence moves us in the opposite direction from chaos to order. I will employ both centripetal and centrifugal modes of design research as described by Rosenberg (2000), using explorative methods that encourage a dialogue between the “constructive and destructive” or “rational and irrational” elements of the creative process. My methods of making include model-making; mapping, diagraming and visualizing objective and subjective ‘data’; code and technical prototypes; and iterating in public.

I want to frame the work as ‘Critical Interaction Design’: designing interactions that challenge the “narrow assumptions, preconceptions and givens” (Dunne & Raby, 2007) that exist at the unique threshold I am exploring. My design methodology is inspired by speculative technology-based practices including BERG, the Near Future Laboratory, Jürg Lehni and Marc Owens. My theoretical framework is informed by a growing list of writings including Daniel Bell’s “The Coming of Post- Industrial Society”, Michel Foucault’s “The Order of Things” and a selection of Lev Manovich’s writings, including “The Language of New Media.”
