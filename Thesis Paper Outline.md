## Mediated-me: Hijacking the Persistant, Collocated Self in the Algorithmic Collective
### .me —v— .us

### Introduction

* I contribute, therefore I am.

### The Self

* Persistent, collocated selves
	* Technologically-mediated perceptions and (re)presentations of self
	* The growth of sharing
	* FOMO [Fear of Missing Out] and other motivations
* 'Ownership' of Self in the Digital Space
	* Hijacking our persistent, collocated 'identities'
	* Loosing oneself in the crowd/perceiving the self in the collective
		* Digital formats/structures: the medium is the message/database defines the user
* Western Individualism: embodied in our technology?
	* User Centred Design

### The Collective

* Inhabiting Demographics: motivations to be part of the Collective
* Ambient intimacy / constant connection
* Crowd: wiser, dumber, stronger, weaker
* The Collective on The Net: Models for collective authoring/representation online:
	* Collaborative, Asynchronous Editing = wiki, source control
	* Collaborative, Synchronous Editing = team-produced content 
	* Hierarchical/editorial = online newspapers
	* Stream of Individuals = blogs, social networks
	* Collated Conversation = usenet, forums, email lists
	* Man as machine = Mechanical Turk 
	* Democratic/voting = Digg, Reddit
	* Collective world-building/role-playing = online gaming

### A Proposal: The Cluster

* Physical presence/proximity as basis for collective web presence 
* Reversing demographics
	* Demographic Resolution
* Algorithmic Collectivism
* Anonymity —v— shared identity

### Conclusion
