### Western Individualism: embodied in our technology?

# Individualism 2.0 (Western, Possessive, Neoliberal)

The kind of Individualism embodied in the social networks of Web 2.0.

-Is Western individualism valuable or destructive?-

Systems? -This idea of a system existing on a individual and collective level. With recent cultural shifts towards individualism, could be an interesting way to explore ethical egoism and ethical altruism. I am also interested in the way that a system exists on two interdependent levels; on an individual and collective level—"interdependent components forming an integrated whole." We exist concurrently as individuals and as nodes in networks at multiple levels: family, community, regional, national. Systems are at play from the micro—cells that make up the organs that make up our bodies—to the macro—the societies that make up humanity which itself is part of a global ecosystem.-

Individualism is "a mode of life in which the individual pursues his own ends or follows out his own ideas" (Oxford English Dictionary). It is an increasingly held moral stance, central to  Western thought. Individualism, or more specifically ethical egoism (that moral agents ought to do what is in their own self-interest) is a key element in the capitalist cultural system. -Within this system, economics is the driving factor. For me, this has lead to money and material b…-

Modern philosophy emerged from the Enlightenment, in key thinkers such as Hobbes and Locke, seeking to distinguish the individual from society. The freedom to understand one's own reality, determine one's own future and decide about one's own beliefs, brought a freedom from existing religious, class and other social categories. A key reason why Individualism became so fundamental was its centrality to the emerging dominant economic system of capitalism. -"free to make their own choices about themselves as commodities."-

Political scientist, C. B. Macpherson identified this as "possessive" individualism, defined as "those deeply internalized habits of thinking and feeling" whereby we view "everything around [us] primarily as actual or potential commercial property" (Graeber). Macpherson's Individual understands itself and its skills (and those of others) are a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market. "In such a society is demonstrated a selfish and unending thirst for consumption which is considered the crucial core of human nature." (Macpherson)

This possessive individualism emerges in its most aggressive -economic- form with the rise of neoliberal economic policies, following the abandonment of Keynesian policies in the 1970s and 80s (those which advocate government policy intervention in the markets). Neoliberal policies seek to increase the role of the private-sector in society through opening markets, deregulating trade, and privatising public service. Neoliberalism understands individual economic freedom as essential; reducing government interference in the economy paves the way for the individual to sustain themselves, and ultimately prosper, in the marketplace.

> "Neoliberalism… proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade." (Harvey, 2)

At both economic and ideological levels, it has profoundly impacted capitalist Western Culture. Beyond simply a set of economic policies, it is particularly evident as a broader worldview in attitudes towards the individual and society. Neoliberalism sees the individual as central, conceiving that if each person is given the 'freedom' to take control of their lives and prosper, they will do so. Margaret Thatcher famously declared that there was, "no such thing as society, only individual men and women". (Harvey, 23) Individualism, private property and personal responsibility for oneself take precedence over social solidarity. We see a subtle shift from the role of the individual as citizen (contributing to and responsible for a society around them) to the role of the individual as consumer (free to earn and buy the life that they desire); individual rights take precedence over individual responsibilities.

As a broad cultural phenomenon, neoliberalism creates a tendency to apply the values of the marketplace to all spheres of life, including the social and cultural.

> "In personal ethics, the general neoliberal vision is that every human being is an entrepreneur managing their own life, and should act as such." (Treanor)

In this everything-entrepreneurship, pursuing and expressing individuality is encouraged in so far as it can be expressed through purchasing power. I am my own person, and I can do whatever I want; I express this through capitalising whenever and however possible, providing me with the liberty to purchase whatever I want in life. In this way, an individualistic understanding of one's identity, and the importance of the financial conditions to obtain and consume the building blocks of the desired identity, becomes central to sustaining the neoliberal economic system.

> Neoliberal ideology does not produce its subjects by interpolating them into symbolically anchored identities (structured according to conventions of gender, race, work, and national citizenship). Instead, it enjoins subjects to develop our creative potential and cultivate our individuality. Communicative capitalism’s circuits of entertainment and consumption supply the ever new experiences and accessories we use to perform this self-fashioning — I must be fit! I must be stylish! I must realize my dreams. I must because I can— everyone wins. If I don’t, not only am I a loser but I am not a person at all. I am not part of everyone. (Dean, 66)

It is this individualism that is not only encouraged, but I believe embedded, within the social networking systems of the Web.

## CONTRAST TO INTERDEPENDENCE

**This rise in individualism contrasts sharply with the reality of our increasing reliance on the global community.** Independent living, at least at a material level, is nearly impossible in today's world, and yet the facade of personal material independence is perhaps more prevalent than ever before. Why is this the case?

There is a **curious contrast** between the modern trend towards individualism and our increasing reliance on the global community. Independent living is nearly impossible in today's world, and yet the facade of personal independence is possibly more valued now than any previous point in history. This ethical egoism—that moral agents ought to do what is in their own self-interest—is central to the history of Western thought from Plato through existentialism.

Twisted fantasy/retelling of this global connectedness.
Neoliberal understanding/sense of the collective:

> In­creas­ing­ly, neoliberalism af­firms tech­nol­o­gy’s fan­ta­sy of wholeness to tell us who “we” are in a glob­al sense. We are those con­nect­ed to each oth­er through ex­change, the ex­change of commodities as well as of con­tri­bu­tions. On the Internet, we are free to buy an­y­thing from an­y­where at any time.
